INTRODUCTION
============

Preface
-------

*"War. War never changes.*

*The Romans waged war to gather slaves and wealth. Spain built an empire
from its lust for gold and territory. Hitler shaped a battered Germany
into an economic superpower.*

*But war never changes.*

*In the 21st century, war was still waged over the resources that could
be acquired. Only this time, the spoils of war were also its weapons:
Petroleum and Uranium. For these resources, China would invade Alaska,
the US would annex Canada, and the European Commonwealth would dissolve
into quarreling, bickering nation-states, bent on controlling the last
remaining resources on Earth.*

*In 2077, the storm of world war had come again. In two brief hours,
most of the planet was reduced to cinders. And from the ashes of nuclear
devastation, a new civilization would struggle to arise."*

*- Ron Perlman, Fallout Intro*

Fallout: Quest is a post-nuclear RPG set sometime after a great nuclear
conflict in the year 2077. 99% of humanity and a good deal of other life
perished in the nuclear war. Many creatures still survived, although
some were altered into mutated abominations beyond imagination. One can
play Fallout: Quest either as a campaign-oriented RPG, with a series of
smaller adventures in a larger story, or as a single-story game with a
minimum of involvement in the larger workings of the world. It can be
played on a single Saturday night with two or three friends or in a
group of seven or eight two or three times a week for months on end. The
only limits are scheduling and the bounds of your imagination.

Much like the popular tabletop RPG, Dungeons & Dragons, Fallout: Quest
is driven by imagination. It's about creating memorable scenarios,
characters, and adventures that will be shared and recounted by you and
your group of fellow players for years to come.

Unlike a game of make-believe, Fallout: Quest gives a structured way of
determining the consequences of the players' actions. Players roll dice
to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their characters
can convince a band of raiders to leave them alone, avoid a super
mutant's sledgehammer, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything
is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.

In the Fallout: Quest, each player creates a character (also called a
survivor or wanderer) and teams up with a group of other characters
played by their friends. Working together, the group might explore a
pre-war science lab, a ruined city, an irradiated cesspool, a raider
boss's hideout, or an underground vault. The wanderers can solve
puzzles, converse with other characters, battle horrible abominations,
and discover fabulous pre-war technology and other forgotten treasures.

One player, however, takes on the role of the Game Master (GM) also
known as the Overseer. The GM acts as the game's lead storyteller and
referee. The GM creates adventures for the characters, who decide what
they want to do and where they want to go. The GM determines the results
of the survivors' actions and narrates what they experience. Because the
GM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, Fallout:
Quest is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and
unexpected.

There is no definitive end to Quest: Combat. Once one adventure is
completed another one can immediately begin. The game also has no real
winners or losers. Sometimes things don't go as planned and a wanderer
may succumb to the perils of the wasteland, however if everyone had a
good time and created a memorable story, they all win.

The Wasteland
-------------

During the Great War, it took no more than two hours for the nuclear
warheads that were fired to change the face of the planet and affect
life on Earth for many centuries to come. After the atomic fire had
cleared, the surface of the Earth was very different.

Millions of buildings and cities were demolished or severely damaged,
with only a few exceptions. Most of the plants that had once flourished
on the Earth died as the Earth was changed from a diverse landscape to a
barren and hot desert, radiation becoming a serious threat to what
little life remained.

Countries such as the United States were turned into scorched
wastelands, filled with new dangers. Hazardous mutations altered the
wildlife, making them more dangerous than before. As the remnants of
humanity began to spread once again, new violence was introduced in the
form of splintered factions. They began warring against each other in a
new anarchic world. Although more than two centuries have passed since
the Great War, progress in the reclamation of society has been slow and
the wasteland remains a radioactive and war-torn desert, in which life
itself is a struggle.

The world of Fallout is typically centered around various regions
spanning the United States from New California to the Capital Wasteland,
each with their own lore and local flavor. However, Fallout: Quest is
not limited to these settings and your GM might want to explore
previously untouched locations such as Louisiana or even China. Because
there is so much diversity in the wastes of Fallout: Quest, you should
check with your GM about any house rules that will affect your play of
the game. Ultimately, the GM is the authority on the campaign and its
setting, even if the setting is a previously established region.

 Using This Guide
-----------------

The *Wasteland Survival Guide* is broken up into three parts.

**Part 1** is about creating a character, providing the rules and
guidance you need to make the character you'll play in the game.

**Part 2** details the rules of how to play the game, beyond the basics
described in this introduction.

**Part 3** is all about equipment. It contains a collection of tables
and descriptions of many of the kinds of items survivors will come
across on their adventures.

Game Dice
---------

The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can
find dice like these in game stores and in many bookstores. In these
rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by
the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d 10, d12, and d20. For instance, a d6
is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).

### The D20

The d20 is the primary catalyst of fate in Fallout: Quest. When a
character performs an action of which the outcome is uncertain, the
player controlling that character rolls a d20. The result of the roll
ultimately decides whether that character's action succeeds or fails.
Every character and enemy in the game has capabilities defined by seven
ability scores. The abilities are **Strength**, **Perception**,
**Endurance**, **Charisma**, **Intelligence**, **Agility**, and
**Luck**, or **SPECIAL** for short. SPECIAL scores typically range from
3 to 18 for most survivors. (Creatures might have scores as low as 1 or
as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability modifiers derived
from them, are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes
on a character's or enemy's behalf.

Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds
of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three
follow these simple steps.

**1. Roll the die and add a modifier**. Roll a d20 and add the relevant
modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the 7
ability scores, and it sometimes includes a Tag Skil bonus to reflect a
character's particular skill.

**2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.** A perk, racial trait,
a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or
penalty to the check.

**3. Compare the total to a target number.** If the total equals or
exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving
throw is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure. The GM (or an opposing
roll in the case of a contest) designates the target number and
determines whether an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw
succeeds or fails.

General Rules 
--------------

### Specific Beats General

This book contains many rules that govern how the game plays. That said,
many racial traits, weapon skills, unique items, monster abilities, and
other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an
exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a
specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins

### Round Down

There's one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever
you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a
fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.

PART 1: CHARACTER CREATION 
===========================

[[[]{#_Toc510011567 .anchor}]{#_Toc510011717 .anchor}]{#_mm8mia8lxg1
.anchor}

Your character is your personal avatar in the game and your primary
channel of interacting with the world. Your character is a combination
of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You also
choose your character's race, traits, and perks, and invent the
personality, appearance, and backstory of your character.

Before building your character, think of the kind of character you would
want to play. You might want to be a survivalist that specializes in
living off the land and picking off opponents from afar, or perhaps a
wasteland merchant that uses their silver tongue to fill their pockets
full of caps. You might want to play something unconventional such as a
super mutant that has dedicated their life to literature and science, or
an android that emulates the tribal warrior spirit. The possibilities
are endless, so who you choose to be is entirely up to you.

Chapter 1: How to Build a Character Step-by-Step
------------------------------------------------

Once you have a character in mind, define the aspects of your character
by following the steps laid out in this section, making decisions that
reflect the character you want. Your conception of your character might
evolve with each choice you make. What's important is that you come to
the table with a character you're excited to play.

### Step 1. Choose a Race

Race defines much of a character's identity by establishing a general
appearance accompanied by ability score modifiers and a unique set of
racial traits. Your character's race also contributes to their cultural
background and shapes how they interact with the world and vice versa.

Detailed descriptions of each race and their racial traits can be found
in the Race section.

### Step 2. Describe Your Character

Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it's time to
flesh him or her out as a person. Your character needs a name. Spend a
few minutes thinking about they look like and how they behave in general
terms.

Flesh out your character's physical appearance and personality traits.
Choose your character's **alignment** (the moral compass that guides
their decisions) and personal beliefs and ideals. Think of what goals
they have and what may influence those goals. Your character's
background describes where they from, their original occupation, and
their general place in the wasteland.

### Step 3. Roll Ability Scores

The name \"SPECIAL\" is an acronym standing for the 7 ability scores
used by the game system: **Strength**, **Perception**, **Endurance**,
**Charisma**, **Intelligence**, **Agility**, And **Luck**. The various
ability scores define a character's capacity to perform most of the
game's actions.

> When creating a character, for each of the 7 ability scores roll 4d6
> and record the cumulative total of the highest 3 numbers. These scores
> can then be swapped around and allocated to each of the 7 ability
> scores. If you do not wish to roll for your ability scores, you may
> simply take the "standard set" of: 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9.

After assigning your ability scores, determine your ability modifiers
using SPECIAL Scale. To determine an ability modifier without consulting
the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result
by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.

A full breakdown of what the ability scores do and the SPECIAL Scale can
be found in chapter 6 of this guide.

### Step 4. Calculate Secondary Stats

In addition to your ability scores and their modifiers, there are an
assortment of secondary statistics that will be referenced as part of
the game. Your secondary stats, such as Hit Points (HP), Defense (DEF),
base speed (SPD), critical strike damage (CRIT), and carry weight (WGT)
are derived from your SPECIAL scores and measure different aspects of
your character. There are more secondary stats than the ones listed
above, but we will calculate and write these down now as they are
referenced most often.

-   **HP:** Hit Points calculate your character's overall health. Your
    total Hit Points are equal to your Endurance plus 30.

-   **DEF:** Defense decreases the probability of an attack hitting you.
    Your base defense is equal to your passive Agility (10 plus your
    Agility modifier).

-   **SPD:** Speed measures how far your character can move in feet.
    Your base speed is 35 feet. For every other Agility modifier, you
    gain or lose an additional 5 feet.

-   **CRIT:** You add your critical strike damage whenever you score a
    critical on an attack roll in combat. Your crit damage is equal to
    your passive Luck (10 plus your Luck modifier).

-   **WGT:** Carry weight measures how much you can carry in pounds. It
    is also related to how much you can lift, push, and throw. Your
    maximum carry weight is equal to your Strength multiplied by 10.

### Step 5. Choose Tag Skills

The next step is to select your Tag skills. Tag skills are the skills
your character excels at. Each character can select three tag skills at
the start of the game. You start off with a Tag skill bonus of +1 which
gets added on to your roll whenever you use one of your Tag skills. Your
Tag skill bonus will increase as you level-up.

### Step 6. Choose Starting Traits

When creating your character, you can select up to two special starting
traits from the traits section. These traits have unique benefits and
drawbacks and can only be chosen at the beginning of the game. You do
not have to select any traits if you don't want to, but you will not be
able to acquire any of the starting traits later on in the game.

### Step 7. Select Starting Equipment

When you create your character, you start with a number of caps at the
start of the game to spend on items found in the item lists. You start
off with a number of caps equal to 4d6 plus your Charisma and Luck
modifiers plus your Barter bonus.

You decide how your character came by this starting equipment. It might
have been an inheritance, or goods that the character purchased during
their upbringing. You might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and
a backpack as part of NCR military service. You might even have stolen
your gear from a fellow wanderer.

### Step 8. Come Together and Play

Most survivors don't work alone. Each character plays a role within a
party, a group of wanderers working together for a common purpose.
Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party's chances to survive
the many perils in the wasteland. Talk to your fellow players and your
GM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they met, and
what sorts of quests the group might undertake.

Chapter 2: Race
---------------

After the events of the Great War, 99% of all life was extinguished from
the earth, however mankind survived. Along with them a few humanoid
species remain. Small remnants of mankind's machinations survived the
nuclear holocaust and others arose from its wake. The four playable
races in Fallout: Quest are Android, Ghoul, Human, and Super Mutant.

Your character's race not only affects your ability scores and racial
traits but also provides the cues for building your character's story.
Each race's description in this section includes information to help you
roleplay a character of that race, including personality, physical
appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies. These
details are suggestions to help you think about your character;
wanderers can deviate widely from the norm for their race. It's
worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way
to think about your character's background and personality.

### Ghoul

Ghouls, necrotic post-humans, are decrepit, rotting, zombie-like
mutants. They are recipients of intense and prolonged radiation sickness
which decays their skin, and in some cases their brains. Their skin
hangs off their bones, sometimes in shreds, and sunken eyes peer out
from skulls twisted and burned by radiation, thus giving these
unfortunate people their name. Their skin can be anywhere from pale
white to dirt brown in color, with green and yellow the most common.
When they do have hair remaining, it usually does not grow.

#### Prejudice and Bigotry

Ghouls are turned away from most human communities and are prejudiced
against due to their outward appearance and the possibility of going
feral. Humans commonly refer to ghouls as "shamblers" or "zombies," and
more often shoot first and ask questions later when they encounter them
in the wastes. Ghouls live most of their lives in social isolation or
within groups of other ghouls.

#### Going Feral

All ghouls eventually go feral when their brains rot, and their mental
faculties are reduced to an animal-like state. Exposure to radiation
seems to exacerbate the process even though it is known to benefit
ghouls in low doses. Feral ghouls travel in packs and attack without
forethought. They can often be found feasting on the remains of
survivors unfortunate enough to cross their path.

#### Ghoul Traits

***SPECIAL Modifiers.***

-   -1 Strength

-   +2 Endurance

-   -2 Charisma

-   +2 Luck

***Age*.** Ghouls enjoy an extremely slow cellular mitosis rate,
rendering them essentially immune to the effects of old age but also
leaving them sterile.

***Alignment.*** Ghouls are often on the chaotic side. The tendency to
shun ghouls away from typical social orders has left them resentful of
laws and authority.

***Crippling Addiction.*** Ghouls are especially susceptible to jet (a
popular wasteland chem) addiction. Ghouls always roll with disadvantage
on addiction saves when taking jet.

***Darkvision**.* As a side-effect of ghoulification, ghouls have
superior vision in dark and dim conditions. Ghouls can see in dim light
within 60 feet of them as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if
it were dim light. They can\'t discern color in darkness, only shades of
gray.

***Healing Glow.*** Ghouls are not only immune to radiation but actually
heal from it. Ghouls heal HP for each rad-level they take.

***Slow Metabolism*.** Ghouls have a natural resistance to all chems,
and thus when taking chems, ghouls only receive a fraction of their
effects. Chems last one round shorter (but not less than one) for ghouls
and stimpaks only heal half the usual HP. Ghouls are also resistant to
bleeding, disease, and poison.

### Human

Humans, or homo sapiens (sometimes called smoothskins or normals by
ghouls and super mutants, respectively) are a species that have been
more-or-less unaffected by radiation. In post-nuclear America, four
major ethnic groups have so far been distinguished: African, Asian,
Caucasian, and Hispanic. Evolved and mutated humans, while still members
of the homo genus, are a different species from regular humans.

#### Rebuilding the Wasteland

Humans desperately cling to the world they ruined even centuries after
its destruction. Humans have set up small settlements across the
wasteland in hopes of reclaiming some of the old world's former glory
and shielding themselves from the horrors of the wastes.

Merchants and caravans routinely travel from settlement to settlement,
braving the arid sands and hostile creatures of the wastes to sell
recovered trinkets of the old world and new commodities alike. Others
have turned to banditry and raiding in order to survive, believing that
in a world without order only violence and power will rule.

#### Vault Dwellers

While most humans are the descendants of above-ground survivors of the
Great War's aftermath, others are the children of survivors locked away
in underground fallout shelters called vaults. Officially, the vaults
were designed for the sole purpose of sheltering up to one thousand
citizens in the event of a nuclear holocaust; however, in reality, they
were a series of secret experiments orchestrated by Vault-Tec and
the United States government. The experiments ranged from genetically
modifying the genome of the vault's inhabitants to locking away a single
man solely accompanied by a box of puppets. Vault dwellers do not
typically last long in the wasteland, but those that do prove to be
formidable survivors.

#### Human Traits

***SPECIAL Modifiers. ***

-   +1 SPECIAL of choice

***Age*.** Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than
a century.

***Alignment*.** Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best
and the worst are found among them.

***Sensitive to Radiation*.** Humans are not immune to the radioactive
elements rife throughout the wasteland. Exposure to radiation imposes
detrimental effects on humans called radiation sickness. If a human is
exposed to too much radiation they may become incapacitated, die, or
worse, become a ghoul. More details on the effects of radiation sickness
can be found in the radiation section in chapter 7.

### Super Mutant

Super mutants are mutated humans, products of infection by the Forced
Evolutionary Virus (FEV). They are much taller, bulkier and muscular
than pure strain humans, have (mostly) green, gray, or yellowish skin,
are immune to disease and radiation, and are gifted with superhuman
strength and endurance. Although they are completely sterile, the rapid
regeneration of their cells caused by FEV makes them virtually
biologically immortal (but not immune to death from injury).

#### Unity in Superiority

Like ghouls, mutants are largely outcast from human society. Many of
them prefer it this way, looking on human society as diseased or
inferior because of the prejudice and corruption that still exist

#### West Coast vs. East Coast 

West Coast super mutants were once part of a great army, united under a
single Master. Under the Master, mutants sought to convert the purest
wastelanders into their ranks in an effort to rid the wastes of the
scourge of humanity. After the death of the Master, mutants were
scattered and disorganized, banding together in loose groups with little
order or structure.

East Coast super mutants were bred in Vault 87 with a modified strain of
FEV that further changed their biology. Vault 87 mutants grew larger and
less intelligent with age, allowing them to grow from eight (2.44 m) to
at least twenty feet (6 m) in height; the largest are known as
\"behemoths.\" These behemoths seem to be even less intelligent than
their smaller brethren, talking only in echoing roars and blindly
destroying everything in their path. Behemoths act more like unfettered
beasts than soldiers.

#### Super Mutant Traits

***SPECIAL Modifiers.***

-   +2 Strength

-   +2 Endurance

-   -1 Charisma

-   -2 Intelligence

***Age.*** While they will not normally die due to the normal effects of
aging, super mutants are prone to senility, leading to tendencies to
engage in near-psychotic, aggressive attacks against humans and other
creatures.

***Alignment.*** Super mutants are usually hostile to anyone or anything
that is not another mutant. There are, however, mutants that are docile
and cohabitate with humans, either due to an uncommonly friendly
demeaner or outright senility.

***Bulky.*** Because of their bulky exterior, mutants suffer -3 defense
and can only wear armor designed for mutants.

***FEV Effects.*** Super mutants gain +4 maximum HP and are immune to
disease and radiation as a result of their exposure to the Forced
Evolutionary Virus.

***Ham-Fisted.*** Due to their massive, sausage-like fingers, super
mutants suffer -3 on attack rolls with ranged weapons and cannot use
pistols or SMGs.

### Synth

Synth is a diminutive for "synthetic humanoid" and is used to name
synthetic intelligence units designed by the Institute to look, function
and behave like humans. They are sometimes also called androids or
artificial humans.

#### Generational Complexity

Synths are classified into one of three generations depending on their
complexity:

Generation 1 synths are purely robotic androids, possessing all the
physical capabilities of a human, but being no smarter than a
standard protectron. They resemble a lanky skeleton with metal joints,
mechanical \"organs\" and hydraulic muscles. They are completely loyal
to the Institute and speak in a high-pitched, robotic tone. Like all
robots, they can take large amounts of damage, never backing down from a
fight even with their limbs blown off.

Generation 2 synths are similar in appearance to their predecessors but
are hardier and sheathed in plastic \"flesh\" mounted on a thin metal
lattice surrounding their mechanical skeleton. Though more human-like in
appearance, Gen-2s still possess limited A.I. and superficially resemble
a mannequin more than a human, having visible seams along their sickly,
yellow-gray skin. Their skin is fragile however and will fall off in
large chunks if struck or shot with enough force to reveal their
mechanical insides. They also speak in a robotic voice, but at a much
lower pitch than Gen 1 synths.

Generation 3 synths represent the pinnacle of synth technology, being
virtually indistinguishable from natural-born humans down to the
cellular level. Each Gen 3 synth is built from lab-grown bones, muscles
and other tissues that are assembled and brought to life at the
Institute\'s Robotics lab and are \"born\" with the bodies and mental
faculties of full-grown adult humans. Though entirely biological, each
Gen 3 synth contains a neurological implant inside their brain allowing
them to be \"programmed\" and manipulated via voice commands. This
implant cannot be detected nor removed without killing the synth.

#### Slavery and Freedom

The synths\' Institute creators view them as nothing more than machines
and treat them as slaves. The Railroad has committed itself to freeing
Generation 3 synths from their masters and smuggling them out of the
Commonwealth to somewhere the Institute cannot reach them. In contrast,
the Brotherhood of Steel has sworn to eliminate all synths, for to them,
a machine capable of thinking like a human is an abomination of
technology.

#### Synth Traits

***SPECIAL Modifiers.** *

-   +2 Perception

-   +2 Intelligence

-   -2 Agility

-   -1 Luck

***Age.*** Generation 1 and 2 synths do not age but do break down as
their parts corrode over time; generation 3 synths however age just like
humans.

***Alignment*.** Early-gen Synths seek to serve their masters and so
typically have an alignment of lawful neutral. Generation 3 synths and
other prototypes have free will and thus can have any alignment.

***Metal Frame*.** Due to their nonorganic metallic construction, synths
have a base DT of 5. Armor doesn't stack on top of this base but serves
as an overall minimum DT. They also are immune to disease, bleed,
poison, and radiation, and are also fire resistant.

***Scrap Repair*.** Although synths cannot heal through the use of aid
items, synths can use scrap metal found throughout the wasteland to
repair minor damage. If a synth has scrap metal, they can use it to heal
+1d6 HP plus their Repair bonus at the cost of a Major action.

***Sensitive Circuitry*.** Synths are especially susceptible to pulse
damage and thus take 1d12 damage and are staggered when inflicted with
pulse.

[[]{#_Toc510011573 .anchor}]{#_Toc510011723 .anchor}***Synthetic
Biolog*y.** Early-gen synths are not composed of organic materials and
so cannot reap the benefits of using chems, food, or aid items.

Chapter 3: Personality & Background
-----------------------------------

Characters are defined by much more than a collection of perks and game
statistics. They're individuals with their own stories, interests,
connections, and capabilities beyond those that stats and race define.
This chapter touches on the details that distinguish characters from one
another, including the basics of physical description, the variety of
backgrounds, and the finer points of personality and alignment.

### Character Details

Your character's name and physical description might be the first things
that the other players at the table learn about you. It's worth thinking
about how these characteristics reflect the character you have in mind.

#### Name

Think carefully about what you want to be called. A name can reflect a
great deal about the type of character someone is playing and give
insight into who they are and what they're about. If you can't
immediately think of a name, flesh out some other aspects of your
character and come back to it later.

#### Sex

You can play a male or female character without gaining any special
benefits or hindrances. In the wasteland, the norms of sexual behavior
are a thing of the old-world, so you can express your sexual identity
however you please.

#### Physical Characteristics

You choose your character's age and the color of their hair, eyes, and
skin. To add a touch of distinctiveness, you might want to give your
character an unusual or memorable physical characteristic, such as a
scar, a limp, or a tattoo. Physical characteristics often come with a
story, so think carefully about how your character looks in conjunction
to their personality and history.

#### Alignment

Are you a do-gooder who wants to maintain social order in the wasteland
or a conniving evil-doer who just wants to see the world burn? Perhaps
you are somewhere in-between. A Character's general moral and personal
attitudes are represented by their alignment. The matrix works on two
axes: **lawful vs chaotic** and **good vs evil**.

Alignment is a tool for developing your character\'s identity. It is not
a straitjacket for restricting your character. Each alignment represents
a broad range of personality types or personal philosophies, so two
characters of the same alignment can still be very different from each
other. In addition, few people are completely consistent.

When choosing an alignment for your character, you should typically pick
something on either neutral or good spectrum. Unless your GM is running
a campaign in which all the characters are evil, playing an evil
character in a neutral to good party disrupts group cohesion and,
frankly, makes all the other players angry at you.

More detailed descriptions of each alignment are displayed in the table
below.

### Personality & Characteristics

Fleshing out your character's personality --- the array of traits,
mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person a unique
identity --- will help you bring them to life as you play the game. Four
categories of characteristics are presented here: personality traits,
ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your
character's favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices
and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.

#### Personality Traits

Give your character at least two personality traits. Personality traits
are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every
other character. Your personality traits should tell you something
interesting and fun about your character. They should be
self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character
stand out. "I'm smart" is not a good trait, because it describes a lot
of characters. "I've read every book by William Shakespeare" tells you
something specific about your character's interests and disposition.
Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, their
past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your
character's self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of their
ability scores.

#### Ideals

Describe at least one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are
the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental moral and
ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass
everything from your life goals to your core belief system. Ideals might
answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will
never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you
to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most
important thing you strive for? You can choose any ideals you like, but
your character's alignment is a good place to start defining them.

#### Bonds

Create at least one bond for your character. Bonds represent a
character's connections to people, places, and events in the world. They
tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to
heights of heroism or lead you to act against your own best interests if
they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a
character's motivations and goals.

Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about?
To what place do you feel a special connection? What is your most
treasured possession?

Your bonds might be tied to your background, your race, or some other
aspect of your character's history or personality. You might also gain
new bonds over the course of your adventures.

#### Flaws

Finally, choose at least one flaw for your character. Your character's
flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness --- in
particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to
ruin or cause you to act against your best interests.

More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer
any of these questions: What enrages you? What's the one person,
concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?

### Inspiration

Inspiration is a rule the Overseer can use to reward you for playing
your character in a way that's true to their personality traits, ideal,
bond, and flaw. You can gain inspiration by calling on your bond to the
defense of your home village to defeat a super mutant war chief,
engaging in your gambling vice and lose in a game you know is rigged, or
reprimanding a town guard for abusing a beggar because of your ideal of
compassion.

#### Gaining Inspiration

Your GM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons.
Typically, GMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give
in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray
your character in a compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can
earn inspiration in the game.

You either have inspiration or you don't --- you can't stockpile
multiple "inspirations" for later use.

#### Using Inspiration

If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll,
saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you
advantage on that roll regardless of additional circumstances.

Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for
good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in
the game. When another player character does something that really
contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up
your inspiration to give that character inspiration.

### Backgrounds

Every story has a beginning. Your character's background reveals where
you came from, how you became a wanderer, and your place in the
wasteland.

#### Customizing Your Background

What you did before you joined your party of wanderers is entirely up to
you. Were you part of a village that was raided by bandits? Were you
part the member of The Brotherhood of Steel before being excommunicated?
Perhaps you were simple wasteland thief trying to make a living selling
stolen wares?

Let your ability scores, Tag skills, and personality traits complement
the background you choose in order to make a well-rounded,
three-dimensional character.

Chapter 4: Starting Traits
--------------------------

Starting traits -- or just traits -- modify aspects of gameplay,
granting a benefit in one area at the cost of hampering another. Traits
can only be chosen at character creation and cannot be modified or added
to your character later.

Each trait modifies (and hampers) your character's statistics in some
way; this can include SPECIAL scores, secondary stats, and skills. When
making your character, you may choose a maximum of two (with a minimum
of zero) traits.

Some traits are exclusive to certain races. For example, a synth could
not have the Vat Skin trait and a human could not have the Glowing One
trait.

### List of Traits

#### General Traits

**Bruiser**

A little slower, but a little bigger. You may not hit as often, but they
will feel it when you do! You always roll with disadvantage on attack
rolls but deal +1d12 bonus damage on hit.

**Chem Resistant**

You try to avoid the quick thrills of chemical enhancements. Chems only
affect you half as long as normal (minimum of 1 round), but you roll
with advantage on addiction saves.

**Claustrophobia**

You have a fear of enclosed spaces. You gain +1 to your SPECIAL
modifiers when outside but suffer -1 when indoors.

**Fast Shot**

You don\'t have time to aim for a targeted attack, because you attack
faster than normal people. You gain +3 when rolling initiative but
cannot target limbs.

**Four Eyes**

You could never really see without your glasses. While wearing any type
of glasses, you gain +1 Perception, but without glasses you suffer -1
Perception.

**Finesse**

Your attacks show a lot of finesse. You don\'t do as much damage, but
you cause more critical hits. Lower your crit threshold by 1, but you
always roll with disadvantage on damage rolls.

**Gifted**

You have more innate abilities than most, so you have not spent as much
time honing your skills. You gain +1 to all SPECIAL scores but suffer -1
to your Tag skill bonus.

**Good Natured**

You studied less-combative skills as you were growing up. Your combat
skills start at a lower level, but other skills are substantially
improved. Gain +1 to Barter, Medicine, Repair, Science, and Speech
checks, but suffer -1 to Energy Weapons, Explosives, Guns, Melee
Weapons, and Unarmed checks.

**Heavy Handed**

You swing harder, not better. Your attacks are very brutal, but lack
finesse. You rarely cause a good critical hit, but you always do more
melee damage. You roll with advantage on damage rolls with melee and
unarmed weapons but suffer -5 critical strike damage.

**Hoarder**

You've always felt better with a backpack full of stuff. You gain +50
lbs. to your carrying capacity but suffer a -1 to SPECIAL modifiers any
time the weight you\'re carrying drops below 150 lbs.

**Jinxed**

The good thing is that everyone around you has more critical failures in
combat, the bad thing is -- so do you! Raise the crit fail threshold of
your enemies by 1 but also yours.

**Kamikaze**

By not paying attention to any threats, you can act a lot faster in a
turn. You gain +5 when rolling initiative but suffer -2 to your total
DT.

**Night Person**

As a night-time person, you are more awake when the sun goes down. You
gain +1 to Intelligence and Perception checks at night but suffer -1 to
Intelligence and Perception checks during the day.

**One Hander**

One of your hands is very dominant. You always roll with advantage on
attack rolls with one-handed weapons in your dominant hand but suffer
disadvantage on all other attack rolls.

**Skilled**

Since you spend more time improving your skills than a normal person,
you start with better skills levels. The tradeoff is that you do not
gain as many extra abilities. You gain +2 to your Tag skill bonus but
only gain a perk every other level.

**Small Frame**

You are not quite as big as other people, but that never slowed you
down. You gain +1 Agility and +1 defense but cut your carrying capacity
in half.

**Trigger Discipline**

You take your time with things to line up a better shot. You gain +1 on
attack rolls with ranged weapons but suffer -4 when rolling Initiative.

#### Ghoul Traits

**Fear the Reaper**

You have cheated death! You gain perks more quickly than when you were
still alive. Unfortunately, you are now on death\'s short list! You gain
2 perks every level but do not gain any additional HP.

**Glowing One**

Extreme radiation exposure has left you glowing in the dark! Darkness is
no obstacle to you or your enemies. You heal twice as much in radiation
but roll with disadvantage on Sneak checks.

#### Human Traits

**Fast Metabolism**

Your metabolic rate is increased. This means that you are much less
resistant to radiation and poison, but your body heals faster. You take
twice the normal amount of radiation and roll with disadvantage when
making saving throws against poison but heal +1 HP every round.

#### Super Mutant Traits

**Ham Fisted**

Genetic engineering has endowed you with huge hands. You get an extra
Tag skill on Unarmed but suffer a -1 penalty on Guns, Lockpick,
Medicine, Repair, and Science checks.

**Vat Skin**

Other people find you hideous to behold and vomitous to smell! You gain
+2 bonus DT, but you roll with disadvantage on all Charisma checks and
any friend or foe in close-range suffers -1 penalty to all Perception
checks.

#### Synth Traits

**Beta Software**

You are equipped with experimental software. Select a 4th Tag skill but
raise your crit fail threshold by 1.

**EMP Shielding**

You have a dedicated EMP shielding system. This makes you heavier and
therefore slower. You gain resistance against pulse damage and can make
a DC 15 Endurance check to resist all pulse effects, but you suffer -2
Agility.

Chapter 5: Leveling-Up & Perks
------------------------------

As your character goes on adventures and completes quests, they gain
experience, represented by experience points. When your character racks
up enough experience points (XP), they reach a new degree in their
capabilities. This advancement is called **leveling-up**.

When your character levels up, they gain +1 maximum HP and get to select
a perk, granting them special bonuses and abilities. As your character
levels-up they might get access to new perks that were not previously
available to them at lower levels. In addition to a perk, your
character's Tag skill bonus increases every 5 levels.

### Tiers of Play

The shading in the Character Advancement table shows the four tiers of
play. The tiers don't have any rules associated with them other than the
Tag skill bonus increase; they are a general description of how the play
experience changes as characters gain levels.

In the first tier (levels 1-5), characters are effectively novice
wanderers. They are learning the basics of their perks and abilities.
The threats they face are relatively minor, usually posing a danger to
small villages.

In the second tier (levels 6-10), characters come into their own.
Characters have begun to specialize into their particular niches and
have gained a decent amount of helpful equipment. These characters have
become important, facing dangers that threaten wasteland towns and
cities.

In the third tier (levels 11-15), characters have reached a level of
power that sets them high above the ordinary populace and makes them
special even among adventuring survivors. Characters have gained enough
perks and equipment to be especially formidable. These mighty survivors
often confront threats to whole regions.

At the fourth tier (levels 16-20), characters achieve the pinnacle of
their strength, becoming heroic (or villainous) archetypes in their own
right. They have fleshed out their perks and gained unique weapons and
equipment. The fate of the wasteland or even the world might hang in the
balance during their adventures.

Characters can keep leveling past level 20 if the GM allows it. To
calculate the experience required for any level past 20, use the
following formula: *(n^2^/2) x 1,000 XP*, where *n* stands for the
level. No new perks are offered past level 20, but characters can
continue picking up perks that they had skipped out on up to this point.
A Character's Tag skill bonus also keeps growing every 5 levels past 20.

###  Perks

Whenever your character levels up they gain a new special ability, or
perk. Perks range from active skills with cooldowns to passive abilities
and other effects. Each perk can only be taken once.

Before acquiring certain perks, you must meet a set of perk
requirements. Requirements can range from level, SPECIAL, race, other
perks, or some other additional requirements.

Perk requirements referring to your SPECIAL scores are measured by their
natural values. So, if you have an item or buff that temporarily raises
your Strength score from 13 to 14, you could not acquire perks that
require 14 Strength. The same works in the opposite direction.

If you acquire a perk and then lose its requisites later on, you get to
keep the perk. For example, a character with the Better Criticals perk
would not lose the effects of the perk if their Luck fell below 12.

#### Passive Perk List

[]{#_Hlk523863982 .anchor}The passive perk list contains a collection of
passive perks organized by level. Passive perks are always active and
have no action cost or cooldown associated to them. Each perk lists its
requirements as well as its effects.

select any perk at or below their level that they satisfy the
requirements for.

cooldown associated with them, dictating how they can be used in combat.

1 can be used once per round and abilities with a cooldown of 2 can be
used every other round. Abilities without a cooldown can be used

#### Combat Perk List

You can gain new abilities for your weapon or combat style of choice by
taking combat perks. Much like active perks, combat perks have action
costs and cooldowns. Combat perks sometimes have specific requirements
but never level requirements. Combat perks relating to weapons can only
be used with the weapons of their respective class. Combat perks come in
one of two varieties: combat perk kits and combat kit upgrades.

Combat perk kits offer several perks for the price of one, giving
characters the essential abilities for a style of combat or a particular
weapon class. Before you can pick up combat perk kits of a particular
class, you must first take its basic kit, i.e. you must take the basic
gun kit before getting the pistol kit.

Combat kit upgrades allow you to improve your favorite combat perks and
abilities (or even gain completely new ones) to further specialize your
character. Unlike combat kits, upgrades can only be taken one at a time
and can only be taken if you have already acquired their respective
combat kit.

PART 2: WANDERING & COMBAT RULES
================================

As you make you way around the wastes you'll need to become familiar
with how to use your ability scores along with the two modes of play:
**wandering** and **combat**. The wandering section covers the finer
points of traveling the wasteland, dealing with radiation, and
interacting with NPCs. The combat section covers how combat engagements
work and the various methods by which you can slay your foes.

Chapter 6: Ability Scores (SPECIAL)
-----------------------------------

Ability scores (also known as SPECIAL scores) define a character's
capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses. The name \"SPECIAL\" is an
acronym standing for the 7 ability scores used by the game system:
**Strength**, **Perception**, **Endurance**, **Charisma**,
**Intelligence**, **Agility**, And **Luck**. The various ability scores
define a character's capacity to perform most of the game's actions. The
three main rolls of the game --- the ability check, the saving throw,
and the attack roll --- rely on the 7 ability scores.

This guide 's introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls:
roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the 7 ability
scores, and compare the total to a target number. This chapter focuses
on how to use ability checks and saving throws, covering the fundamental
activities that creatures attempt in the game.

-   **Strength \[STR\]** measures your character's ability to carry
    objects and fight with melee weapons, as well as their raw physical
    power.

-   **Perception \[PER\]** measures your character's ability to use
    their five senses, investigate, and aim with ranged weapons.

-   **Endurance** **\[END\]** measures your character's stamina,
    physical toughness, ability to survive, and resistance to disease.

-   **Charisma \[CHA\]** measures your character's ability to speak and
    interact with other characters.

-   **Intelligence \[INT\]** measures your character's mental acuity and
    ability to reason, as well as their proficiency with medicine and
    technology.

-   **Agility \[AGL\]** measures your character's dexterity and
    reflexes, as well as their ability to move on their feet and sneak.

-   **Luck \[LCK\]** measures your character's critical attack power, as
    well as their chances of success in gambling or situations where no
    other ability score applies.

### SPECIAL Modifiers

Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging
from 5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). Because
ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and
saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their
associated scores.

The SPECIAL scale notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible
ability scores, from 1 to 30.

  **SPECIAL**   **Modifier**      **SPECIAL**   **Modifier**
  ------------- -------------- -- ------------- --------------
  1             -5                16-17         +3
  2-3           -4                18-19         +4
  4-5           -3                20-21         +5
  6-7           -2                22-23         +6
  8-9           -1                24-25         +7
  10-11         +0                26-27         +8
  12-13         +1                28-29         +9
  14-15         +2                30            +10

To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract
10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes a perk, weapon skill, or environmental factor will dictate
that your roll has advantage or disadvantage. When that happens, you
roll a second d20. Use the higher roll if the you have advantage and use
the lower if you have disadvantage.

If multiple situations grant advantage or disadvantage a Character does
not roll more than one additional d20.

If circumstances cause you to have both advantage and disadvantage, the
roll is considered to have neither of them, and you only roll a single
d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and
only one grants advantage or vice versa.

### Ability Checks

An ability check tests a character's or enemy's innate talent and
training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an
ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than
an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain,
the dice determine the results. For every ability check, the GM decides
which of the 7 SPECIAL scores is relevant to the task at hand and the
difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class (DC). The more
difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes
table shows the most common DCs.

**Typical Difficulty Classes**

  **Difficulty**      **DC**
  ------------------- --------
  Very easy           5
  Easy                10
  Medium              15
  Hard                20
  Very hard           25
  Nearly impossible   30

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability
modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and
compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the
ability check is a success --- the creature overcomes the challenge at
hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or creature
makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a
setback determined by the DM.

#### Contests

Sometimes one character's efforts are directly opposed to another's.
This can occur when both are trying to do the same thing and only one
can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a disarmed weapon that has
fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is
trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal --- for
example, when a mutant tries to force open a door that a survivor is
desperately holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is
determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest. Both
participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their
efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead
of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two
checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest.
That character or mutant either succeeds at the action or prevents the
other one from succeeding. If the contest results in a tie, the
character that first initiated the action wins.

#### Critical Rolls 

Critical rolls, also known as crits, occur when you roll one of the two
extremes of the d20 (1 or 20) on an ability check, attack roll, or
saving throw. Crits increase the impact of success or failure. Crits are
unique in that they must be rolled naturally and cannot be modified into
or out of.

When you roll a natural 20 on your d20 you score a critical success and
perform outside the normal realm of possibility for your character. In
combat this means you add your critical strike damage to your attack
damage. Outside of combat, a critical success provides additional
benefits to the action your character is trying to perform outside of
being successful. For example, if you roll a crit success when trying to
hold off a monster from opening a door, you might slam the door shut
with such force that it breaks the opening mechanism and traps the
monster on the other side.

When you roll a natural 1 on your d20 you score a critical failure. Crit
fails are the exact opposite of crit success in that they automatically
result in catastrophic or even comedic failure. Using the same example
as before, if you roll a crit success when trying to hold off a monster
from opening a door, the monster might bash through the door with such
force that you are knocked down and pinned by the monster without an
opportunity to react.

The effects of critical successes and failures are not always defined,
so it is up to your GM to decide the effects in certain scenarios.

##### The Crit Threshold

Traits, perks, items, or abilities may change your crit threshold, thus
modifying the range of numbers that trigger a crit. Lowering the crit
threshold by 1 would reduce the requirement for a crit success to 19 and
lowering it again would reduce the requirement to 18. The same goes for
raising the crit fail threshold but in the opposite direction.

#### Tag Skills

Tag skills are your character's specific specializations. Each skill
represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and your Tag skills
represent your focus on that aspect. A well-rounded character usually
tags at least one diplomatic and one combat skill. A fighter will Tag
combat skills whereas a diplomat may choose speech, barter and science.

Characters have a Tag skill bonus determined by level. Creatures and
enemies also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat
blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws,
and attack rolls involving skills that you've tagged.

Your Tag skill bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other number
more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your
Tag Skill bonus to an Intelligence saving throw, you nevertheless add
the bonus only once when you make the save.

The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following
list. (No skills are related to Luck). See an ability's description in
the later sections of this chapter for examples of how to use a skill
associated with an ability.

**Strength**

-   Melee Weapons

-   Unarmed

**Perception**

-   Energy Weapons

-   Guns

**Endurance**

-   Explosives

-   Survival

**Charisma**

-   Speech

**Intelligence**

-   Medicine

-   Repair

-   Science

**Agility**

-   Lockpick

-   Sneak

Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill
--- for example, the GM might say, "Make a Survival (Endurance) check."
At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular
skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means
an individual can add their Tag skill bonus to ability checks that
involve that skill. Without having a skill tagged, the individual makes
a normal ability check.

#### Passive Checks

A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve
any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task
done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again
or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the
characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a
hidden monster.

Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check: 10 +
all modifiers that normally apply to the check. If the character has
advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.

The game refers to a passive check total as a passive score. For
example, if a character has a Perception of 15 they have a passive
Perception of 12.

#### Working Together

Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The
character who's leading the effort --- or the one with the highest
ability modifier --- can make an ability check with advantage,
reflecting the help provided by the other characters (in combat, this
requires using the Help action). A character can only provide help if
the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying
to pick a lock requires proficiency with thieves' tools, so a character
who lacks that proficiency can't help another character in that task.
Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working
together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a
needle, are no easier with help.

##### Group Checks 

When a number of characters are trying to accomplish something as a
group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation,
the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who
aren\'t. To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the
ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group
succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails. Group checks don't come up very
often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail
as a group. For example, when survivors are navigating a radioactive
cesspool, the GM might call for a group Survival (Endurance) check to
see if the characters can avoid radiation pockets, sinkholes, and other
natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds,
the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of
danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.

### Using SPECIAL Scores

Every task that a character or creature might attempt in the game is
covered by one of the 7 ability scores. This section explains in more
detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.

#### Strength \[STR\]

Strength measures your character's ability to carry objects and fight
with melee weapons, as well as their raw physical power.

##### Strength Checks

A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break
something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply
brute force to a situation. The Melee Weapons and Unarmed skills are
covered under Strength.

**Melee Weapons.** Melee Weapon checks cover whenever you attempt to use
your melee weapon either inside or outside of combat. Examples include
attacking a creature with a combat knife or knocking a door down with
your super sledge.

**Unarmed.** Unarmed checks cover whenever you attempt to use your
unarmed weapon either inside or outside of combat. Examples include
fighting in a bare-knuckle boxing match or punching a hole through a
wall with a powerfist.

**Other Strength Checks.** The GM might also call for a Strength check
when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door

-   Climb, swim jump, or perform an athletic feat

-   Break free of bonds

-   Push through a tunnel that is too small

-   Hang on to a car bumper while being dragged behind it

-   Tip over a statue

-   Keep a boulder from rolling

##### Melee Weapon Attack Rolls and Damage. 

You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and add your Strength
modifier to your base damage when attacking with a melee or unarmed
weapon such as a spear or gauntlet. You use melee and unarmed weapons to
make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be
thrown to make a ranged attack.

##### Lifting, Carrying and Throwing

**Carrying Capacity**. Your carrying capacity is your Strength score
multiplied by 10. This is the weight (measured in pounds) that you can
carry. If you carry weight in to your carrying capacity you become
over-encumbered, which means your speed drops to 5 feet and you have
disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use
Strength, Endurance, or Agility.

**Push, Drag, or Lift.** You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds
up to twice your carrying capacity (or 20 times your Strength score).
While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity,
you become over-encumbered.

**Throwing Distance**. You can throw objects that are one size smaller
than you or smaller a distance in feet up to half your carrying capacity
(or 5 times your Strength score). For every size larger divide this
number by two.

**Size and Strength.** Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas
Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium,
double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push,
drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.

#### Perception \[PER\]

Perception measures your character's ability to use their five senses,
investigate, and aim with ranged weapons.

##### Perception Checks

A Perception check measures your general awareness of your surroundings
and the keenness of your senses. A Perception check might come into play
when you attempt to use any one of your five senses: sight, smell,
hearing, taste, and touch to detect or otherwise identify the presence
of something. The Energy Weapons and Gun Skills reflect your aptitude
with ranged weapons using Perception.

**Energy Weapons.** Energy Weapons checks measure your proficiency with
laser, plasma, and other energy-based weapons. The GM might call for an
Energy Weapons (Perception) check when shooting a creature with your
plasma pistol or attempting to light a campfire with a blast of your
laser rifle.

**Guns.** Guns checks measure your aptitude and skill with guns and
other projectile-based ranged weapons. You might use your Guns skill
when shooting a creature with your 10mm pistol or firing a mortar.

**Other Perception Checks.** The GM might call for a Perception check
when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Detecting a lie

-   Finding a hidden object or door

-   Discerning whether a creature is alive or dead

-   Searching for traps or ambushes

##### Ranged Weapon Attack Rolls

You add your Perception modifier to your attack roll when attacking with
a ranged weapon, such as an energy weapon, gun, or bow.

#### Endurance \[END\]

Endurance measures your character's stamina, physical toughness, ability
to survive, and resistance to disease.

##### Endurance Checks

Endurance checks measure your wherewithal and general fortitude. An
endurance check may come into play when you attempt to brave through a
radiation storm, fight against the effects of chem withdrawal, or
survive without food and water. There are no skills related to
Endurance, but the GM might call for an Endurance check when you try to
accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Hold your breath

-   March or labor for hours without rest

-   Go without sleep

##### Hit Points

Your Hit Points (HP) measure your character's overall health and you
lose Hit Points when your character is hurt or wounded in combat. Your
maximum HP is equal to your Endurance score plus 30.

#### Charisma \[CHA\]

Charisma measures your character's ability to speak and interact with
other characters. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence,
and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.

##### Charisma Checks

A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain
others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or
when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Barter and Speech
skills measure different aspects of your charismatic capabilities.

**Barter.** The Barter skill helps you haggle with shopkeepers and
traveling merchants. When buying or selling wares, the GM might ask for
a Barter check to see if whoever you are buying from or selling to will
accept the proposed deal.

**Speech.** Speech checks come into play whenever you attempt to
deceive, intimidate, or persuade another character. Some of examples of
this would be using a disguise, pry information from a captive, or
convince a warlord to leave a settlement out of his warpath.

**Other Charisma Checks.** []{#_Hlk521237104 .anchor}The GM might call
for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the
following:

-   Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip

-   Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation

-   Delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some
    other form of entertainment.

#### Intelligence \[INT\]

Intelligence measures your character's mental acuity and ability to
reason, as well as their proficiency with medicine and technology.

##### Intelligence Checks

An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic,
education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Explosives, Medicine,
Repair, Science, and Survival skills reflect different aspects of
Intelligence.

**Explosives.** The Explosive skill measures your aptitude with
explosive weapons and munitions. Explosives checks might come into play
when cooking a grenade, cutting the right wire to disarm a bomb, or
planting a mine.

**Medicine.** Medicine checks measure your ability to heal wounds and
use medical supplies. You might need to make a Medicine check when
attempting to diagnose and treat a disease or tend to a particularly
grievous gash or wound.

**Repair.** Whenever you need to repair a broken item, craft a new one,
or otherwise put things together. The Repair skill may come into play
when crafting ammunition or working from a set of schematics.

**Science.** Science checks are required when working with new and
old-world technology. Tasks such as hacking a terminal, working with lab
equipment, or crafting microfusion cells for an energy weapon will make
use of the Science skill.

**Survival.** The Survival skill comes into play whenever you attempt to
craft chems or other consumable items from materials found around the
wasteland. The GM might also ask you to make a Survival check to follow
tracks, predict the weather, avoid natural hazards, or otherwise rely on
knowledge of the environment.

**Other Intelligence Checks.** The GM might call for an Intelligence
check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Recall lore or other historical events

-   Look around for and investigate clues

-   Communicate with a creature without using words

-   Estimate the value of an item

-   Forge a document

##### Energy Weapon Damage

You add your Intelligence modifier to the base damage of energy weapons
such as laser, plasma, or tesla weapons.

#### Agility \[AGL\]

Agility measures your character's dexterity and reflexes, as well as
their ability to move on their feet and sneak.

##### Agility Checks

An Agility check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or
quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Lockpick and
Sneak skills make use of different aspects of Agility.

**Lockpick.** The Lockpick skill measures your acuity with cracking
locks. The Lockpick skill may come into play when cracking a locked
safe, ammunition box, or cell door.

**Sneak.** Make a Sneak check when you attempt to conceal yourself from
enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up
on someone without being seen or heard.

**Other Agility Checks.** The GM might call for an Agility check when
you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Vault over waist-high cover

-   Disable a trap

-   Securely tie up a prisoner

-   Wriggle free of bonds

-   Hide from an enemy

##### Attack Rolls and Damage

You add your Agility modifier to your attack roll and add your Agility
score to your base damage when attacking a melee weapon that has the
finesse property, such as a shiv, dagger, or a rapier.

##### Defense

Your passive agility score composes your base defense. If an enemy's
attack roll is less than your defense score, the attack misses and you
avoid all damage. Your base defense is equal to 10 plus your Agility
modifier and is further modified by external factors like cover.

##### Speed

All characters have a base speed (SPD) of 30 feet. A character gains or
loses 5 feet every other modifier away from +0. For example, a character
with an Agility modifier of +2 would have a speed of 35 feet, and a
character with an Agility modifier of -2 would have a speed of 25 feet,
and so on.

##### Initiative 

At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making an
Agility check. Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in
combat. For more information on turn order and initiative, see those
headings in the Combat section in chapter 8.

#### Luck \[LCK\]

Luck measures your character's critical attack power, as well as their
chances of success in gambling or situations where no other ability
score applies.

##### Luck Checks

A Luck check occurs when a character is outside the bounds of skill and
totally within the realm of chance or fate. There are no skills that
apply to Luck, but your GM might call for a Luck check when you try to
accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Looting a corpse for caps and ammunition

-   Avoiding death when at 0 HP

-   Gambling at a casino

-   Avoiding being struck by lightning

##### Critical Strike Damage

When scoring a natural 20 on an attack roll, you get to add your
critical strike damage to your attack roll. Critical strike damage is
calculated by multiplying your Luck score by 2.

### Saving Throws

A saving throw --- also called a save --- represents an attempt to
resist an attack, trap, poison, disease, or a similar threat. You don't
normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one
because your character or monster is at risk of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability
modifier. For example, you use your Agility modifier for an Agility
saving throw. A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or
penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined
by the DM.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that
causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw from a ranged attack
is determined by the shooter's roll plus any modifier or Tag skill
bonuses.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in
the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a
creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.

 Chapter 7: Wandering the Wastes
--------------------------------

Whether its exploring a derelict robotics factory, investigating a
mysterious town, or just wandering the wasteland, there will always be
new and exciting perils and adventures.

This chapter covers the basics of the wandering life, from the mechanics
of movement to the complexities of social interaction. The rules for
resting are also in this chapter, along with a discussion of the
activities your character might pursue between adventures.

As discussed in this guide's introduction, the game follows a basic
pattern.

1.  The GM describes the environment.

2.  The players describe what they want to do.

3.  The GM narrates the results of their actions.

Typically, the GM uses a map as an outline of the adventure, tracking
the characters' progress as they explore dungeon corridors or wasteland
regions. The GM's notes, including a map legend, describe what the
survivors find as they enter each new area. Sometimes, the passage of
time and the wanderers' actions determine what happens, so the GM might
use a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress instead of a map.

### Time

In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important,
the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different
time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a
dungeon environment, the adventurers' movement happens on a scale of
**minutes**. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway,
another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall,
and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything
interesting or valuable.

In a city or wilderness, a scale of **hours** is often more appropriate.
The wanderers navigate through the irradiated bog in just under four
hours' time.

For long journeys, a scale of **days** works best. Following the road
from Shady Sands to Junktown, the wanderers spend four uneventful days
before a mutant ambush interrupts their journey.

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on
**rounds**, a 10-second span of time described in chapter 9.

### Movement

Wandering through a bombed-out neighborhood, swimming across an
irradiated river, creaping down a dungeon corridor, scaling a craggy
mountain slope - all sorts of movement play a key role in Fallout: Quest
adventures. The GM can summarize the wanderers' movement without
calculating exact distances or travel times: "You travel through the
petrified forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of
the third day." Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a
cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: "After
destroying the sentry at the entrance to the abandoned brotherhood
bunker, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing
corridors to a computer mainframe loaded with old world government
secrets." Sometimes it's important though to know how long it takes to
get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or
minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors:
the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain
they\'re moving over.

#### Speed

Every character and creature has a speed, which is the distance in feet
that the character or monster can move in 1 round of combat. This number
assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a
life-threatening situation. The following rules determine how far a
character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.

##### Travel Pace

While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or
slow pace, as shown on the **Travel Pace table**. The table states how
far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any
effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace
makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully
(see the "Activity While Traveling" section later in this chapter for
more information).

**Forced March.** The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel
for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of
exhaustion. For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the
characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace,
and each character must make an Endurance saving throw at the end of the
hour. The DC is 10 plus 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving
throw, a character becomes **exhausted** and thus rolls with
disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws
until their next long rest.

**Travel Pace Table**

  **Pace**   **Minute**   **Hour**   **Day**   **Effect**
  ---------- ------------ ---------- --------- -----------------------
  Slow       200 ft       2 mi       18 mi     Able to sneak
  Normal     300 ft       3 mi       24 mi     ---
  Fast       400 ft       4 mi       30 mi     -5 passive Perception

##### Difficult Terrain

The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively
simple terrain: roads, open wasteland, or clear dungeon corridors. But
adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins,
steep mountains, and ice-covered ground --- all considered difficult
terrain. You move at half speed in difficult terrain---moving 1 foot in
difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed---so you can cover only half the
norm al distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.

#### Different Types of Movement

Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves
more than simply walking. Survivors might have to climb, crawl, swim, or
jump to get where they need to go.

##### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling

While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2
extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or
swimming speed. At the GM's discretion, climbing a slippery vertical
surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength,
Endurance, or Agility check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough
water might require a different successful check.

##### Jumping

Your Agility determines how far you can jump.

**Long Jump.** When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up
to your Agility score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately
before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only
half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a
foot of movement. This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't
matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM 's option,
you must succeed on a DC 10 Agility check to clear a low obstacle (no
taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low
wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Agility
check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you are staggered for 1 round
when you hit the ground.

**High Jump.** When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number
of feet equal to 3 plus your Agility modifier if you move at least 10
feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high
jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you
clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your
GM might allow you to make a check to jump higher than you normally can.
You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the
jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of
the jump plus your 1.5x your height.

#### Activity While Traveling

As adventurers travel through a dungeon or the wilderness, they need to
remain alert for danger, and some characters might perform other tasks
to help the group's journey.

##### Squad Formation

The survivors should establish a squad formation. A formation makes it
easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones
can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies
when a fight breaks out. A character might occupy the front rank, one or
more middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front and back
ranks need enough room to travel side by side with others in their rank.
When space is too tight, the marching order must change, usually by m
oving characters to a middle rank.

**Fewer Than Three Ranks.** If a party arranges its formation with only
two ranks, they are a front rank and a back rank. If there's only one
rank, it's considered a front rank.

##### Stealth

While traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move stealthily. As
long as they're not visible and in the open, they can try to surprise or
sneak by other creatures they encounter. See the rules for hiding in
chapter 7.

##### Noticing Threats

Use the passive Perception scores of the characters to determine whether
anyone in the group notices a hidden threat. The GM might decide that a
threat can be noticed only by characters in a particular rank. For
example, as the characters are exploring a maze of tunnels, the GM might
decide that only those characters in the back rank have a chance to hear
or spot a stealthy creature following the group, while characters in the
front and middle ranks cannot.

While traveling at a fast pace, characters take a -5 penalty to their
passive Perception scores to notice hidden threats.

**Encountering Creatures.** If the GM determines that the adventurers
encounter other creatures while they're traveling, it's up to both
groups to decide what happens next. Either group might decide to attack,
initiate a conversation, run away, or wait to see what the other group
does.

**Surprising Foes.** If the adventurers encounter a hostile creature or
group, the GM determines whether the adventurers or their foes might be
surprised when com bat erupts. See chapter 9 for more about surprise.

##### Other Activities

Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels
are not focused on watching for danger. These characters don't
contribute their passive Perception scores to the group's chance of
noticing hidden threats. However, a character not watching for danger
can do one of the following activities instead, or some other activity
with the GM's permission.

**Navigate.** You can try to prevent the group from becoming lost,
making an Intelligence or Survival check when the GM calls for it.

**Draw a Map.** You can draw a map that records the group's progress and
helps the characters get back on course if they get lost. No ability
check is required.

**Track.** You can follow the tracks of another creature, making a
Perception or Survival check when the GM calls for it.

**Scavenge.** You can keep an eye out for sources of food, water, scrap,
and other resources, making a Perception or Survival check when
theGMcalls for it.

### Radiation

Easily the most prolific and dangerous hazard in the wasteland is
radiation. Radiation has trickled into nearly every nook and cranny in
the of the environment at some capacity and brought about ghastly
mutations in the local wildlife.

Ionizing radiation, often referred to in-game as simply radiation or
rads, is the chief delayed effect of a nuclear explosion. It has long
lifetimes, with half-lives ranging from days to millennia. The primary
source of these products is the debris left from fission reactions. A
potentially significant secondary source is neutron capture by
non-radioactive isotopes both within bombs and in the outside
environment.

#### Radiation Sources

Generally, the primary source of exposure to radiation is via irradiated
food and drink. Most water sources are irradiated. Various water sources
will differ in the concentration of radiation, and drinking from an
irradiated source will always be more hazardous than coming into contact
with the water.

Craters left by nuclear warheads are also usually areas of highly
concentrated radiation.

Another primary source of radiation is from toxic waste dumped pre-War.
These brown and white barrels can often be found in various locations,
usually emitting low to medium levels of radiation in a close vicinity.
Areas emitting higher levels in wider areas can be found at larger dump
sites throughout the Fallout universe. Unlike the real world, which
imposes restrictions that prevent the dumping of toxic waste, the
pre-War Fallout universe seemed to have no such restrictions and dumping
was not uncommon due to the high yields of toxic waste created from
various forms of production and experiments.

#### Mutations

The ionizing radiation that has infected the wasteland has irreversibly
altered the its surviving wildlife. Radiation exposure alters a living
creature's DNA thus resulting in abnormal growths or mutations.
Radioactive contamination has produced an assortment of mutated
creatures such as two-headed cattle, giant ants, fire-breathing geckos,
ghouls, and a plethora of other sickening horrors.

#### Measuring and Detecting Radiation

A **rad** is a unit of measurement used to measure the level of
radiation in an area. The rad is a real unit meaning radiation absorbed
dose. It is equal to 0.01 gray. 1 gray means 1 joule of ionizing
radiation was absorbed by 1 kilogram of matter, so 1 rad means 0.01
joules of radiation was absorbed by 1 kilogram of matter. In real life,
although the rad is not used very often, it is still a valid scientific
unit of measurement.

For every 100 rads a character is exposed to, they gain a **rad-level**.
For the purpose of the game, we will use the term rad-level as the
standard measure of radiation exposure for a character.

Radiation is undetectable to the naked eye. As described by Jake in
Fallout, *"Some call it the Phantom Death, \'cause that\'s what it is.
You can\'t see it, you can\'t hear it, you can\'t even smell it. It
basically builds up in your system. You never feel it until it\'s too
late."* Radiation can only be measured and detected with the use of a
Geiger counter, which makes a distinct ticking noise in the presence of
radiation fields.

#### Rad-Zones

When a character enters a radiation field, also known as a **rad-zone**,
they take a dose of radiation depending on its strength or level. The 6
rad-zone levels and their associated radiation exposures can be found in
the **Rad-Zone Level Table** below**.**

**Rad-Zone Level Table **

  **Rad-Zone Level**   **Rad-Level**
  -------------------- ---------------
  1                    1d4
  2                    1d6
  3                    1d8
  4                    1d10
  5                    1d12
  6                    1d20

Whenever a character passes through a space occupied by a rad-zone, they
take the corresponding amount of radiation determined by its level. If a
character ends their turn in a rad-zone, they take the associated amount
of radiation even if they had been afflicted by that rad-zone once
previously during their turn.

Rad-levels from rad zones are gained on a per mile (or per tile basis)
when traveling.

#### Effects of Radiation

The effects of radiation vary from being deadly to beneficial depending
on your race and the amount of radiation you are exposed to.

##### Humans

Humans are the most susceptible to the deadly effects of radiation. When
a human is exposed to concentrated amount of radiation, they acquire an
acute illness called **radiation poisoning.** For every 2 rad-levels a
human is exposed to, they gain a different degree of radiation
poisoning. The effects of each level of radiation poisoning can be found
in the table below.

**Radiation Poisoning Table**

+---------------+-------------------+---------------------+
| **Rad-Level** | **Rad Poisoning** | **Effects**         |
+===============+===================+=====================+
| 0-1           | ---               | ---                 |
+---------------+-------------------+---------------------+
| 2-3           | Minor             | -1 on all rolls     |
+---------------+-------------------+---------------------+
| 4-5           | Advanced          | -2 on all rolls     |
+---------------+-------------------+---------------------+
| 6-7           | Critical          | -3 and disadvantage |
|               |                   |                     |
|               |                   | on all rolls        |
+---------------+-------------------+---------------------+
| 8-9           | Deadly            | -4 and disadvantage |
|               |                   |                     |
|               |                   | on all rolls        |
+---------------+-------------------+---------------------+
| 10            | Fatal             | Death               |
+---------------+-------------------+---------------------+

**Ghoulification.** When a human develops deadly radiation sickness,
they make a DC 5 Luck check. If they fail, they undergo the painful
process of ghoulification. The character's race is changed to ghoul and
they slowly start to suffer the effects of necrosis. Their hair and skin
begin to fall off as well as bits and pieces of their extremities until
they look like a zombified husk of their former selves.

##### Ghouls

Ghouls are especially attuned to radiation exposure and gain benefits
from it rather than drawbacks in most situations. Ghouls heal +1 HP for
every rad-level they take. Stronger radiation sources do have drawbacks
for ghouls however.

Ghouls exposed to a level 5+ rad zone must pass a DC 10 Intelligence
check or have a **feral episode** and attack the closest target to them
regardless if they are a friend or foe.

Ghouls exposed to a level 10+ rad zone must pass a DC 10 Intelligence
check or go feral **permanently**. Feral ghouls attack any non-ghouls on
sight and have no memory of their previous lives.

##### Other Races

The other races, including super mutants and synths are immune to
radiation exposure and have no positive or negative effects in the
presence of it.

#### Reducing Rad-Level

There are two main methods of reducing a character's rad level: using a
radaway and seeing a doctor. Using a radaway reduces a character's
rad-level their Medicine skill plus 2 (with a minimum of 1). Seeing a
doctor reduces a character's rad-level to 0 regardless of how irradiated
they are.

**Ghouls.** Ghouls lose HP for every point of rad-level reduction they
take.

#### Rad Resistance

Armor and other effects may afford to a character a certain amount of
**rad resistance**. A character's rad resistance score is a threshold
that radiation sources must break through before a character takes any
radiation. A character takes the remainder of the rad-level they are
exposed to subtracted by their rad resistance.

### Hazards and Environmental Factors

The wasteland is naturally treacherous and filled with environmental
perils in addition to the threatening flora and fauna. This section
covers natural hazards of the wasteland as well as its more benign
aspects.

#### Falling

A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing a
wanderer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d4 damage for every 10
feet it fell. The creature is stunned for 1 round when it hits the
ground, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.

#### Suffocating

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to one plus
its Endurance modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). When a creature runs out
of breath, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Endurance
modifier (minimum 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0
hit points and is dying.

#### Vision and Light

The most fundamental tasks of wandering --- noticing danger, finding
hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to
name just a few --- rely heavily on a character's ability to see.
Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant
hindrance.

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a **lightly
obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage,
creatures have disadvantage on Perception checks that rely on sight.

A **heavily obscured area**---such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense
foliage---blocks vision entirely. A creature in a heavily obscured area
effectively suffers from the blinded status effect (see chapter 8).

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three
categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days
provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources
of illumination within a specific radius.

**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An
area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright
light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of
twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant
full moon might bathe the land in dim light.

Darkness creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness
outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an
unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault.

##### Blindsight

A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying
on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as
oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as
bats and true dragons, have this sense.

##### Darkvision

Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness
as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly
obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature
can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Food and Water

Characters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion.
Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be removed until the
character eats and drinks the full required amount.

#### Food

A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last
longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a
day counts as half a day without food. A character can go without food
for a number of days equal to 3 plus their Endurance modifier (minimum
1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character suffers from
exhaustion. A norm al day of eating resets the count of days without
food to zero.

#### Water

A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if
the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water
must succeed on a DC 10 Endurance saving throw or suffer from exhaustion
at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water is
automatically exhausted.

### Crafting

In their downtime, characters can utilize their scavenged supplies to
craft various useful items and weapons. When a character has scavenged
the relevant items to craft an object, they make a Repair or Survival
check depending on the item in an attempt to craft it. The required
materials and the DC of the check are presented in the item lists. If
the check fails, the components break and are unsalvageable. Crafting an
item usually takes 30 minutes to an hour to complete.

**Improvised Crafting.** Whenever a character wishes to craft an item
that is not detailed in the item lists or wishes to substitute an item
in the crafting recipe, the GM gives the required items, the relevant
skill, and the required DC if it is possible.

### Interacting with Objects

A character's interaction with objects in an environment is often simple
to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM what their character is
doing something, such a moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if
anything happens. For example, a character might decide to pull a lever,
which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with
water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall.

If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to
force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to
see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets
the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.

Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells.
Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can
be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The
GM determines an object's hit points and might decide that certain
objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It's
hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail
Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects
that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it
breaks.

A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM
sets the DC for any such check.

### Social Interaction

Whether its bartering with a caravan merchant, talking down a raider
gang leader, or questioning an aberrant wastelander, communication and
social interaction is a crucial part of Fallout: Quest.

The GM assumes the roles of any characters who are participating in the
interaction that don't belong to another player at the table. Any such
character is called a nonplayer character (NPC). In general terms, an
NPC's attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or
hostile. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are
inclined to get in your way. It's easier to get what you want from a
friendly NPC, of course. Social interactions have two primary aspects:
roleplaying and ability checks.

#### Roleplaying

Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case,
it's you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts, and
talks.

Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the
fore during social interactions. Your character's quirks, mannerisms,
and personality influence how interactions resolve.

There are two styles you can use when roleplaying your character: the
descriptive approach and the active approach. Most players use a com
bination of the two styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best for
you.

##### Descriptive Approach

With this approach, you describe your character's words and actions to
the GM and the other players. Drawing on your mental image of your
character, you tell everyone what your character does and how he or she
does it.

When using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in mind:

-   Describe your character's emotions and attitude.

-   Focus on your character's intent and how others might perceive it.

-   Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with.

Don't worry about getting things exactly right. Just focus on thinking
about what your character would do and describing what you see in your
mind.

##### Active Approach

If descriptive roleplaying tells your GM and your fellow players what
your character thinks and does, active roleplaying shows them.

When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character's voice,
like an actor taking on a role. You might even echo your character's
movements and body language. This approach is more immersive than
descriptive roleplaying, though you still need to describe things that
can't be reasonably acted out.

##### Results of Roleplaying

The GM uses your character's actions and attitudes to determine how an
NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles under threats of violence. A stubborn
mutant threatens anyone attempting to badger badger her. A vain hive
mind laps up flattery.

When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the GM 's portrayal
of the NPC 's mood, dialogue, and personality. You might be able to
determine an NPC 's personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then
play on them to influence the NPC 's attitude.

Interactions in the game are much like interactions in real life. If you
can offer NPCs something they want, threaten them with something they
fear, or play on their sympathies and goals, you can use words to get
almost anything you want. On the other hand, if you insult a proud
warrior or speak ill of a noble's allies, your efforts to convince or
deceive will fall short.

#### Ability Checks

In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining the
outcome of an interaction. Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC's
attitude, but there might still be an element of chance in the
situation. For example, your GM can call for a Charisma check at any
point during an interaction if he or she wants the dice to play a role
in determining an NPC 's reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in
certain situations, at your GM 's discretion.

### Resting

The toils of the wasteland beat down every survivor eventually and they
will need to take time to rest. Resting is the time for tending your
wounds and preparing yourself for the journey ahead.

Wanderers can take short rests in the midst of the day and a long rest
at the end of the day.

#### Short Rest

A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which
a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading,
and tending to wounds.

A character can heal an amount of HP equal to 4d20 adding your Medicine
skill to each roll.

#### Long Rest

A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long,
during which a character sleeps or perform s light activity: reading,
talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest
is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity --- at least 1 hour of
walking, fighting, or other adventuring activity --- the characters must
begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it. At the end of a long
rest, a character regains all lost hit points.

A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour
period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of
the rest to gain its benefits.

 Chapter 8: Combat
------------------

This chapter provides the rules you need for your characters and
monsters to engage in combat, whether it is a brief skirmish or an
extended conflict in a dungeon or on a battlefield. Throughout this
chapter, the rules address you, the player or Game Master. The Game
Master controls all the monsters and nonplayer characters involved in
combat, and each other player controls an adventurer. "You" can also
mean the character or monster that you control.

### Order of Combat

The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns.
A **round **represents about 10 seconds in the game world. During a
round, each participant in a battle takes a **turn**. The order of turns
is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone
rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to
the next round if neither side has defeated the other.

Combat follows a general pattern:

1.  **Determine Surprise:** The GM determines whether anyone involved in
    the combat encounter is surprised.

2.  **Establish Positions:** The GM decides where all the characters and
    creatures are located. Given the survivors' marching order or their
    stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out
    where the adversaries are --- how far away and in what direction

3.  **Roll Initiative:** Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls
    initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns

4.  **Take Turns:** Each participant in the battle takes a turn in
    initiative order.

5.  **Begin Next Round:** When everyone involved in the combat has had a
    turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.

#### Surprise

A band of survivors sneaks up on a mutant camp, springing from the dunes
to attack them. A deathclaw creeps down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by
the wanderers until the creature pounces on one of them. In these
situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.

The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be
stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM
compares the Sneak checks of anyone hiding with the passive Perception
score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster
that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you're surprised, you can't take any action on your first turn of
combat other than moving, and you can't take a reaction until that turn
ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members
aren't.

#### Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat
starts, every participant makes an Agility check to determine their
place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group
of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same
time.

The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest
Agility check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order
(called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The
initiative order remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to
determine the order, highest roll going first.

Characters can move their turn later in the initiative order to
coordinate with their squad but cannot move their turn earlier.

#### Your Turn

In most cases, you have two kinds of actions to expend on your turn ---
a Minor action and a Major action.

**Minor Action.** Minor actions are smaller, less involved actions. Some
Minor actions include moving, reloading your gun, or accessing an item
in your inventory. You can continue making actions after your first
Minor action, but your turn ends if you make a second.

**Major Action.** Major actions are reserved for more costly,
time-consuming actions. Some Major actions include, making an attack,
dashing, or changing out your armor. Your turn ends after making a Major
action unless you are granted a bonus action.

##### Bonus Actions

Some abilities or environmental factors will give you an additional
Minor or Major action called a bonus action. You can take only one bonus
action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when
you have more than one available.

You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the
bonus action's timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of
your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus
action.

##### Other Activity on Your Turn

Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither of
your actions.

You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and
gestures, as you take your turn. You can also interact with one object
or feature of the environment for free, during either your one of your
actions. For example, you could open a door during your move as you
stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same
action you use to attack.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use an action.
The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities
when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For
instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use a Minor or Major
action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge
depending on the difficulty of the action.

#### Reactions

Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a
special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a
trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's.

When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of
your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that
creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.

### Movement and Position

In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using
movement and position to gain the upper hand.

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as
much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the
rules here. Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming.
These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they
can constitute your entire move. While you're moving you deduct the
distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up
or until you are done moving.

#### Kinds of Movement Actions

On your turn, you have two kinds of movement actions available to you
---the Move action and the Dash action.

**Move action.** The Move action allows you to move up to your speed and
costs one Minor action. You can break up your Move action, making a
Minor action in between intervals of movement but never a Major action.
You can only make one Move action in a single turn.

**Dash action.** The Dash action allows you to move up to your speed and
costs you your Major action. You gain +1d4 on defense against reactions
while dashing and can convert a dash action into certain perk abilities
such as charge if you have them.

#### Using Different Speeds

If you have differing speeds for different kinds of movement, such as a
walking speed and a hover speed, you can switch back and forth between
your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance
you\'ve already moved from the higher speed. The result determines how
much farther you can move up to the maximum of the new speed. If the
result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current
move.

For example, if you have a walking speed of 30 and a hovering speed of
60, you could hover 20 feet, then walk 30 feet, and then hop into the
air to hover 10 feet more.

#### Difficult Terrain

Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains.
Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases ---
the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This
rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult
terrain.

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs
are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature,
whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.

#### Going Prone

Combatants can choose to go prone to gain some special advantages at the
cost of their movement speed. You can drop prone without using any of
your actions but standing back up takes a Minor action.

You gain +1d4 to Sneak checks while prone as well as to attack rolls and
defense with and against ranged attacks respectively. Melee attack rolls
have disadvantage while prone.

To move while prone, you must **crawl**. Every foot of movement while
crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain,
therefore, costs 3 feet of movement

#### Moving Around Other Creatures

You can move through a non-hostile creature's space. In contrast, you
can move through a hostile creature\'s space only if the creature is a
size larger than you or smaller. Another creature's space counts as
difficult terrain for you regardless if they are a friend or foe. You
also can't end your move in another creature's space even if they are
your ally.

**Shoving.** If you attempt to pass through an enemy character's space,
they can attempt to shove you. In doing so, you enter a contest, rolling
an Agility check against their Strength check. If the shove is
successful, you are kept out of their space and lose any remaining
movement. Otherwise you are free to continue to move your remaining
speed.

#### Creature Size

Each creature takes up a different amount of space depending on its
size. The size of a creature doesn't necessarily express its physical
dimensions, but the amount of space it effectively controls in combat.
The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a
particular size takes up in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size
categories.

**Size Categories**

  **Size**     **Occupied Space**   **Defense Modifier**
  ------------ -------------------- ----------------------
  Tiny         2.5 x 2.5 ft         +2
  Small        5 x 5 ft             +1
  Medium       5 x 5 ft             +0
  Large        10 x 10 ft           -2
  Huge         15 x 15 ft           -4
  Gargantuan   20+ x 20+ ft         -6

#### Squeezing into a Smaller Space

A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a
creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze
through a passage that\'s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a
space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there,
and it has disadvantage on attack rolls.

### Actions in Combat

When you make an action on your turn, you can take one of the actions
presented here, an action you gained from a perk or weapon feature, or
an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their
own in their stat blocks.

#### Access the Inventory

If you need to take a quick stimpak, swap weapons, or grab an item from
your backpack, you can do so with the Access the Inventory action. You
can grab and use any item in your inventory or swap your currently
equipped weapons with the use of a single Minor action.

#### Activate a Perk

Some active perks grant you an additional ability to use in combat that
isn't necessarily a kind of Attack action. Active perks such as Moral
Support, Quick Recovery, or Grim Reaper's Sprint can be Activated to
gain bonus actions or grant additional effects. An active perk's Action
Cost depends on the perk and is listed in its description in the perks
section.

#### Attack

The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether
you are swinging a club, firing a shotgun blast, or brawling with a
ballistics fist. With this action, you make a melee or ranged attack at
the cost of your Major action. See the "Making an Attack" section for
the rules that govern attacks.

#### Dodge

At the cost of a Major action, you can focus entirely on avoiding
incoming attacks. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a bonus
+1d6 defense against each attack and you make Agility saving throws with
advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your
speed drops to 0.

#### Hide

At the cost of a Major action, you can attempt to Hide and regain
concealment. When you make a Hide action, you make a Sneak check
following the rules in chapter 7 for hiding. If you succeed, you regain
concealment. You can only attempt to Hide after remaining out of a
target's line of sight for 3 or more rounds.

#### Improvise

Your character can do things not covered by the actions in this section,
such as breaking down doors, sensing weaknesses in a foe, or doing a
sweet backflip before landing an attack. The only limits to the actions
you can attempt are your imagination and your character's ability
scores. See the descriptions of the ability scores in chapter 6 for
inspiration as you improvise.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM
tells you whether that action is possible, what that action costs, and
what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or
failure.

#### Ready a Minor Action

You can spend your Major action to ready a Minor action as a reaction on
an ally's or enemy's turn.

To do so, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your
reaction. Then, you choose the Minor action you will make in response to
that trigger. Some examples include "If the robot steps on the trapdoor,
I'll push the button that opens it," or "If the molerat steps next to
me, I'll move away."

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after
the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take
only one reaction per round.

#### Search

You can attempt to sniff out concealed foes or hidden objects with the
Search action. At the cost of a Minor action, you devote your attention
to finding something or someone. Depending on the nature of your search,
the GM might have you make a Perception check or an Intelligence check.

#### Speak

At the cost of a Minor action, you can Speak to your enemies in an
attempt to engage in conversation with them, either in a hope to
re-establish diplomacy or break them down into surrender. As soon as you
begin your Talk action, a 2-minute real-world timer begins. At the end
of that timer, your turn ends, regardless if you have any remaining
actions or not.

#### Use an Object

You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as
when you draw a pistol as part of an attack. When an object requires an
action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is
also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your
turn. The GM will decide whether Using an Object requires a Minor or
Major action depending on the object and how it is used.

### Making an Attack

Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range,
or making an attack roll as part of an ability, an attack has a simple
structure:

1.  **Choose a target.** Pick a target within your attack's range: a
    creature, an object, or a location.

2.  **Determine modifiers.** The GM determines whether the target has
    cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the
    target. In addition, Ability Scores, Tag skills, special abilities,
    and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack
    roll.

3.  **Resolve the attack.** You make the attack roll. On a hit, you deal
    your base damage plus any relevant bonus damage unless the
    particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks
    cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.

#### Attack Rolls

When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack
hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the
appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers meets or
exceeds the target's defense (DEF), the attack hits. The defense of a
character is determined by their passive Agility plus external
modifiers, whereas the defense of a mutant is in its stat block.

##### Attack Roll Modifiers

When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to
the roll are an ability modifier and the character's Tag skill bonus,
but there are other factors that may come into play. When a monster
makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat
block.

**Ability Modifier.** The ability modifier used for a melee weapon
attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon
attack is Perception. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property
break this rule.

**Tag Skill Bonus.** You add your Tag Skill bonus to your attack roll
when you attack using a weapon with which you have a Tag skill.

**Other Modifiers.** You might add an attack roll modifier due to a
weapon's or ability's accuracy bonus/penalty or due to an environmental
effect such as weather or darkness.

##### Critical Rolls

Rolling a well-timed crit or poorly-timed crit fail on an attack can
often change the tide of a battle.

**Critical Success.** Rolling a crit success on an attack roll makes it
so your attack cannot miss and results in a critical strike, meaning
that you add your critical strike damage to your attack damage.

**Critical Failure.** Rolling a crit fail on an attack roll results in
the weapon breaking or jamming. Weapons broken due to a crit fail must
be fixed through passing a DC 10 Repair check before they can be used
again. Attempting to repair a weapon costs a Minor action.

#### Targeting Limbs

When making an attack, you can choose to aim for any one of a
character's particular limbs. Humanoid characters have 4 limb areas, the
head, torso, legs, and arms.

Attacks are made to the torso by default but attacking a limb other than
the torso grants the opponent a defense bonus and afflicts them with a
unique hit effect depending on which one limb is hit. Hit effects last
for 1 round.

The **defense bonuses** and **hit effects** for targeting a limb can be
found in the Limb Properties table below.

**Limb Properties**

  **Limb**   **DEF**   **Hit Effect**
  ---------- --------- ------------------------------
  Head       +5        Dealt crit damage
  Torso      +0        ---
  Arms       +3        Disadvantage on attack rolls
  Legs       +3        Suffer 1-round stagger

Non-humanoid characters may or may not have targetable limbs. If they
do, the targetable limbs, defense bonuses, and hit effects will be
listed in their stat block.

#### Unseen Attackers and Targets

Combatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, using a
stealth boy, or lurking in darkness.

When you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on
the attack. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location
or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target
isn't in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM
typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the
target's location correctly. When a creature can't see you, you have
advantage on attack rolls against it.

If you are hidden --- both unseen and unheard --- when you make an
attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

#### Melee Attacks

Attacks made with hand-to-hand weapons such as unarmed, slash, blunt, or
pierce weapons are considered melee attacks. Melee attacks may be made
against any characters within your weapon's reach.

**Reach.** The reach of one-handed melee weapons is 5 feet and the reach
of two-handed melee weapons is 10 feet.

#### Ranged Attacks

Attacks made with ranged weapons such as pistols, SMGs, shotguns, ARs,
BRs, LMGs, heavy weapons, or thrown weapons target enemies at range.

**Range.** Ranged weapons have preferred ranges depending on whether
they are close-range, mid-range, or long-range weapons. The further your
target is away from a ranged weapon's preferred range, the less likely
you are to hit. The attack roll modifiers at close, mid, and long-range
for each preferred range are listed in the Preferred Range table below.

**Preferred Range Table**

+---------------------+-----------------+------------------+---------------------+
| **Preferred Range** | **Close-Range** | **Mid-Range**    | **Long-Range**      |
|                     |                 |                  |                     |
|                     | **(5 - 50 ft)** | **(55 -100 ft)** | **(105 -- 150 ft)** |
+=====================+=================+==================+=====================+
| Close               | +0              | -2               | -4                  |
+---------------------+-----------------+------------------+---------------------+
| Mid                 | -2              | +0               | -2                  |
+---------------------+-----------------+------------------+---------------------+
| Long                | -4              | -2               | +0                  |
+---------------------+-----------------+------------------+---------------------+

**Ranged Weapons at Point Blank.** Landing a ranged attack is more
difficult when a foe is right next to you. When you make a ranged attack
against an enemy within 5 feet of you who can see you and isn't
incapacitated, you have disadvantage on your attack roll.

**Elevation.** When attacking a target from a higher elevation, you gain
+1 on your attack roll When aiming up at a target from a lower
elevation, you suffer -1 on attack rolls.

**Magazines and Ammo-Pips.** Guns and other ranged weapons can only hold
a certain amount of ammunition before running out. Each time you make a
ranged attack, you lose one ammo-pip from your weapon's magazine.
Ammo-pips represent a different number of rounds ranging from 1-10
rounds depending on the type of weapon being used.

**Reloading.** When you run out of ammo-pips in your magazine, you need
to reload before you can fire again. Most weapons have a reload cost of
a Minor action, but big guns such as LMGs and heavy weapons may require
a Major action. Remaining ammo in a magazine is lost after reloading.

### Cover

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during
combat, making a target more difficult to hit with ranged attacks. A
target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect
originates on the opposite side of the cover and they had declared that
they had taken that piece of cover on their previous turn. Melee attacks
are unaffected by cover, but you can still apply the flanking bonus
while using them.

#### Degrees of Cover

There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources
of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees
aren\'t added together. For example, if a target is behind a barrier
that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives full cover, the target
has full cover.

**Half Cover.** Waist-high cover such as a sandbag pile, crumbled wall,
or the hood of a car provide half cover to characters hiding behind
them. You gain +4 defense against ranged attacks while behind half
cover.

**Full Cover.** The corners of walls and other barriers as tall as your
character or taller act as full cover. You can only attack out of the
corners of a piece of most full cover, otherwise line of sight is
blocked. You gain +8 defense against ranged attacks while behind full
cover.

**Character Cover.** Character Cover is a variant of half cover that
uses another character, whether they be friend or foe, as the piece of
cover rather than a waist-high barrier or wall. If an attack roll is
high enough to hit both characters, the one behind cover is hit. If an
attack roll is high enough to hit the character providing the cover, but
not the character taking the cover, then that character is hit.
Otherwise the attack hits or misses as usual.

#### Flanking

If you have successfully circumnavigated around a character using a
piece of cover, they are considered Flanked. Attacking flanked
characters grants advantage on your attack and any damage rolls.

### Damage, Healing, and Death

The battlefield is extremely dangerous; it is rare that any combatant
ever leaves it completely unscathed. Thus, taking damage, healing your
wounds, and avoiding death's door is a routine part of combat.

#### Dealing Damage

Upon landing a hit on a target, you follow a couple of simple steps to
determine how much damage you deal:

1.  **Calculate the attack damage.** Upon hitting a target, you start by
    calculating your attack damage. This number includes your weapon's
    base damage, modified with any relevant modifiers. Tag skill
    bonuses, Strength modifiers with melee weapons, Intelligence
    modifiers with energy weapons, etc.

2.  **Subtract the DT.** You then subtract your attack damage from the
    target's DT. The remaining number is then dealt to their HP. Your
    attack damage cannot go below 0.

3.  **Add bonus damage.** After you deal your attack damage you then
    apply any relevant bonus damage. Bonus damage includes any damage
    dealt by dice or other additional damage modifiers. The bonus damage
    is then immediately dealt to the target's HP, bypassing all DT.

#### Damage Types

Different attacks and other harmful effects deal different types of
damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such
as damage resistance, rely on the types.

The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type
to a new effect.

***Acid.*** Corrosive enzymes and toxic chemicals deal acid damage.

***Bludgeon.*** Attacks from blunt weapons such as a tire iron or super
sledge deal bludgeoning damage.

***Cryo.*** Freezing weapons such as the cryolator and cryo mines deal
cryo damage.

***Fire.*** Flame attacks like a fire ant's fire-breath or a strike from
a shishkebab deal fire damage.

***Force*.** Powerful slamming forces such as a crusher anomaly deal
force damage.

***Laser*.** Light beam attacks like the beam of a laser rifle or a
protectron's eye lasers deal laser damage.

***Pierce*.** Puncturing and impaling attacks, such as a sharp spear or
a deathclaw's jaws deal pierce damage.

***Plasma*.** A plasma pistol or a plasma grenade deals plasma damage.

***Poison*.** Venomous stings and bites like a radscorpion stinger or
the bite of a nightstalker deals poison damage.

***Psychic*.** Mental abilities like an alien's psionic blast deals
psychic damage.

***Pulse.*** EMP weapons such as pulse rifles and pulse grenades deal
pulse damage.

***Slash.*** Honed edges and blades such as swords, daggers, and claws
deal slash damage.

***Sonic.*** Sound-based attacks such as a mirelurk king's subsonic
blast deal sonic damage.

***Tesla.*** Electric or lightning based attacks such as a stun baton or
tesla cannon deal tesla damage.

#### Damage Resistance and Vulnerability

Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy
to hurt with certain types of damage.

**Resistance.** If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage
type, damage rolls of that type have disadvantage against it.

**Vulnerability.** If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a
damage type, damage rolls of that type have advantage against it.

#### Hit Points

Hit points represent your overall physical health. Creatures with more
hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are
more fragile.

A creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be
any number from the creature's maximum hit points down to 0. This number
changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit
points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's
capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.

#### Healing

Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Rest can restore a
creature\'s hit points (as explained in chapter 7), and aid items such
as stimpaks can remove damage in an instant.

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are
added to its current hit points. A creature's hit points can't exceed
its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this
number are lost.

#### Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall
unconscious, as explained in the following sections.

##### Instant Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit
points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage
equals or exceeds your maximum hit points.

##### Falling Unconscious

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall
unconscious and cannot make ANY actions. You can only regain
consciousness through the use of a super stimpak or some other ability
or item that specifically revives you. ends if you regain any hit
points.

##### Death Saving Throws

Whenever you start your turn at 0 hit points, you must make a special
saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you
creep closer to death or hang onto life. Death saving throws are a kind
of Luck saving throw.

Roll a d20 modified by your Luck score. If the roll is 10 or higher, you
succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by
itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your
third failure, you die. The successes and failures don\'t need to be
consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The
number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become
stable.

**Critical Rolls.** When you make a death saving throw and roll a crit
fail, it counts as two failures. If you roll a crit success, you regain
1 hit point.

**Damage at 0 Hit Points.** If you take any damage while you have 0 hit
points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a
critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or
exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.

##### Stabilizing a Creature

The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to revive it. If no
means of revival are available, the creature can at least be stabilized
so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw.

You can heal a creature above 1 HP to stabilize, otherwise you can use a
Major action to administer first-aid to an unconscious creature in an
attempt to stabilize it. To successfully stabilize a creature, you must
pass a DC 10 Medicine check. A stable creature doesn't make death saving
throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious.
The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving
throws again, if it takes any damage.

A stable creature that isn't revived regains consciousness after 1d4
hours.

**Monsters and death.** Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops
to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death
saving throws. However, mighty villains, companions, and special NPCs
are com on exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and
follow the same rules as player characters.

#### Knocking a Creature Out

Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a
killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a
melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can
make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls
unconscious and is stable.

### Status Effects

Oftentimes a character will be inflicted with a status effect that
modifies their capabilities or imposes an effect for a certain period of
time. Most status effects, such as stagger, are impairments, but a few,
such as invisible, can be advantageous.

A status effect lasts either until it is countered (using a bandage
counters bleed for example) or for a duration of rounds specified by the
effect that triggered that status.

Status effects do not stack. If you are inflicted with a status effect
that you are already under the influence of, you simply reset the
duration.

Any damage taken as a result of a status effect is dealt at the start of
the afflicted character's turn.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is

PART 3: ITEMS & EQUIPMENT
=========================

A survivor[[[]{#_Toc510011696 .anchor}]{#_Toc510011846
.anchor}]{#_niz9kjdr2o7i .anchor}'s gear may be the only thing standing
between life and death in the day-to-day trials and tribulations of the
wastes. As a wanderer continues to explore and accrue experience, they
also acquire greater and more powerful items and equipment to aid them
in their adventures. This section details the many, many different kinds
of items that wanderers may find or encounter on their journeys and
details on how to use them.

Chapter 9: Wealth
-----------------

The daily trials of survival have completely rewritten the Old-World
ideas of wealth. Pre-War money is seen as nothing, but worthless paper
to wastelanders. Clean water, livestock, and weapons are commonly used
as bartering tools in transactions between wasteland denizens and
traveling caravan merchants. Caps are the primary currency in the wastes
and can be used instead of bartering goods nearly universally.

### Currency

It doesn't matter if you are a savvy scientist, brainless brawler, or
mal-aligned mutant, you, caps are king! Bottlecaps (or just caps for
short) are the wasteland's primary currency.

Backed by the value of water, the Hub merchants supported bottle caps
because the technology to manufacture them and paint their surfaces had
been mostly lost in the Great War, which limited any counterfeiting
efforts. Secondly, there are a limited number of bottle caps, which
preserve their value against inflation to some degree.

For similar reasons the East Coast merchants also recognize bottle caps
as a currency, although who backs them and guarantees their value is
unknown

### Buying, Selling, and Haggling

As you continue to explore the hidden shelters and bunkers of the
wasteland, you will find equipment, weapons, armor, and other treasures.
You can sell the items that you do not wish to keep in towns and other
settlements to wasteland merchants that are interested in what you have
to offer.

**Buying and Selling.** You can buy and sell basic equipment with any
merchant that deals in that particular stock. As a general rule,
merchants will buy any item at 50% its value and sell it at 150% its
value. However, most wasteland dealers will engage you in the ancient
dance of haggling.

**Haggling.** To haggle with a merchant, you state a price and make a
Barter check. If the barter check passes the required DC for the
relevant buy or sell percent listed in the **Marchant Haggling table**,
the merchant will accept the trade. If the check fails, you must raise
or lower your buying or selling price respectively. In the case of a
crit success on a Barter check, the merchant will immediately accept
your deal. In the case of a crit fail, the merchant will buy or sell at
the base price, or not at all.

**Merchant Haggling Table**

  **Barter DC**   **Buy %**   **Sell %**
  --------------- ----------- ------------
  ---             150%        50%
  10              140%        60%
  15              130%        70%
  20              120%        80%
  25              110%        90%
  30              100%        100%

**Limited Supplies.** Wasteland merchant's supplies are not limitless.
Most merchants will only carry a couple thousand caps and a limited
number of whatever their selling. You will sometimes have to make up for
a merchant's limited number of resources by exchanging items instead of
trading in just caps.

 Chapter 10: Armor & Helmets
----------------------------

The only thing standing between you and the wasteland is your armor,
making it one of the most important aspects of a survivor's arsenal.
Armor provides you with your Damage Threshold (DT) as well as various
unique traits depending on the armor class and the armor itself.

### Damage Threshold 

Armor grants you a damage threshold score, otherwise known as DT. DT
directly influences the amount of damage you take by absorbing an amount
of attack damage equal to your DT. Attack damage must be greater than
your DT score before it starts effecting your HP directly.

**Dice Damage.** Although a high DT score may be able to effectively
safeguard you from most attacks, it will not be able to block every bit
of incoming damage. Damage dealt from dice, also known as dice damage or
bonus damage, penetrates DT entirely. Meaning that although a high DT
score may be able to neutralize small arms, a small percent of damage
will get through even the thickest armor.

### Armor Classes 

There are many varieties of armor between the remaining equipment of the
Pre-War and new inventions of the New-World alike. The available types
of armor found in the game are separated into five categories, also
known as armor classes: **clothing**, **light armor**, **medium armor**,
**heavy armor**, and **power armor**. Each armor class has its own
properties in addition to the traits of the armor itself.

#### Clothing

Clothing rarely supplies a DT above 10, but can provide unique boosts to
ability scores, skills, and other bonuses.

***Supplied DT.*** Clothing usually supplies DT scores between 1 and 2.

***Resistances and Vulnerabilities.*** Clothing always has resistance
against pierce damage but has vulnerability against slash damage.

***Effects on Speed and Agility.*** Clothing is light-weight and
maneuverable and thus has no effect on your speed or Agility scores
unless otherwise specified.

#### Light Armor

Light armor is typically made of thin, flexible materials making it the
armor of choice for agile survivors.

***Supplied DT.*** Light armor usually supplies DT scores between 2 and
3.

***Resistances and Vulnerabilities.*** Like clothing, light armor always
has resistance against pierce damage and vulnerability against slash
damage.

***Effects on Speed and Agility*.** Light armor is almost never heavy
enough to impose a speed or Agility penalty.

#### Medium Armor

Medium armor is composed of heavier materials than light armor and thus
offers more protection at the cost of some maneuverability. ***Supplied
DT.*** Medium armor typically supplies DT scores between 3 and 4.

***Resistances and Vulnerabilities.*** Unlike other armor classes,
medium armor has no inherent resistances or vulnerabilities.

***Effects on Speed and Agility.*** Medium armor lowers your speed by 5
feet while wearing it and may come with additional agility penalties
depending on the armor.

#### Heavy Armor

Heavy armor offers excellent protection at the cost of agility and
movement.

***Supplied DT.*** Heavy armor typically supplies DT scores between 4
and 5.

***Resistances and Vulnerabilities.*** Due to its heavy construction,
heavy armor has resistance against slash damage and vulnerability
against pierce damage.

***Effects on Speed and Agility.*** As the name implies, heavy armor is
heavy and penalizes the user with a heavy speed penalty. Heavy armor
lowers your speed by 10 feet while wearing it and usually comes with
additional agility penalties depending on the armor.

#### Power Armor

Power armor was the pinnacle of Pre-War technology. Power armor offers
the greatest defense available but is so heavy that it requires internal
micro-motors to allow movement. Power armor also grants additional
bonuses on top of its amazing level of protection.

***Supplied DT.*** Power armor typically supplied DT scores between 5
and 6.

***Resistances and Vulnerabilities.*** Like heavy armor, power armor has
resistance against slash damage and vulnerability against pierce damage.

***Effects on Speed and Agility.*** Power armor is the heaviest armor
imaginable, thus reducing your speed by 15 feet while wearing it. Power
armor almost always comes with additional agility penalties.

***Hydraulic Actuators.*** Power armor is outfitted with hydraulic
actuators that boost the wearers strength. You gain +2 Strength while
wearing power armor and do not suffer speed penalties from heavy-duty
weapons.

***Kinetic Servos.*** Power armor is equipped with kinetic servos that
are capable of absorbing over 2500 Joules of kinetic impact. You ignore
500 feet of fall damage while wearing power armor.

***Hermetically Sealed.*** When power armor is worn alongside a power
helmet, the armor is completely closed off from the outside environment.
The user breathes through a respirator, thus preventing them from
suffocating and giving them +3 rad resistance.

***Power Armor Training.*** Before you can wear power armor, you must be
instructed on how to use it. If you try to use power armor without power
armor training, you must pass a DC 15 Science save or else the armor
malfunctions and you take 1d20 damage and are stunned.

### Helmets

Helmets can be worn is addition to your armor to provide bonus DT and
additional effects. Helmets fall into the same classes as armor sets but
provide significantly less DT. Helmets, like armor, often have traits
and agility penalties of their own as well.

If your helmet has different resistances than your armor set, you only
apply those resistances when your head is attacked.

#### Differing Armor and Helmet Classes

You can wear helmets of different class than your armor but are
penalized for wearing a higher helmet class than your armor class.

For every class your helmet is above your armor set, you suffer -1
Agility. For example, if you are wearing medium armor and a heavy
helmet, you suffer -1 Agility; if you are wearing clothing and a power
helmet, you suffer -4 Agility.

You don't gain any bonuses or suffer any penalties by wearing an armor
set of a higher class than your helmet.

#### Changing Armor and Helmets

The time it takes to get in or out of armor and put on or remove a
helmet is simple. It requires a Major action to equip or unequip an
armor set and a Minor action to equip or unequip a helmet, regardless of
its armor or helmet class.

 Chapter 11: Weapons
--------------------

Your weapons are your primary means of survival in skirmishes against
monsters and other wasteland inhabitants. There are two main
classifications of weapons, **melee** and **ranged**. The further
classifications, properties, and additional features of both melee and
raged weapons are broken down in the following sections.

**Strength Requirements.** Both melee and ranged weapons have a specific
Strength requirement to use them. Using a weapon without meeting its
Strength requirement results in all rolls with that weapons having
disadvantage. When dual-wielding two one-handed weapons, you must to
have the sum of their Strength requirements to properly wield them. The
Strength requirement for each weapon is listed with its description in
the item lists.

### Melee Weapons

Melee weapons are used for hand-to-hand combat against enemies that are
very close or right in front of you.

#### Melee Classes

Melee weapons are broken up into the following classes: **slash**,
**blunt**, **pierce,** and **shield**.

##### Slash

Slash weapons include most weapons with sharp edges such as daggers,
knives, and swords.

***Razors-Edge.*** Because of their honed edge, slash weapons deal slash
damage.

##### Blunt

Blunt weapons are weapons that deal damage by force of impact, such as a
metal bat or a sledgehammer.

***Impact-Force.*** Since blunt weapons deal damage from impact alone,
they deal bludgeon damage.

##### Pierce

Pierce weapons have a sharpened point, such as a shiv, spear, or horn.

***Pointed-Tip.*** Due to their sharp point, pierce weapons deal pierce
damage.

##### Shield

Shields are personal barriers to protect yourself from harm and can be
anything from a sheet of metal to a riot shield

***Bonus DT and DEF.*** Shields grant a bonus to your overall DT and
defense depending on what shield you are using. You don not benefit from
your shield's bonus DT or defense while flanked or incapacitated.

***Blocking.*** You add your Strength modifier to your defense score
when using a shield.

***One-Handed.*** It only requires one hand to use a shield.

#### Damage Scaling

Most melee weapons have Strength scaling, meaning that you add your
Strength modifier to your attack damage when using them. Some melee
weapons are **finesse weapons**, meaning that they scale from Agility
instead of Strength.

### Ranged Weapons

Ranged weapons are used against enemies at a distance and are affected
by cover and ammunition types.

#### Ranged Classes

Ranged weapons are broken up into the following classes: **pistol**,
**submachine gun,** **shotgun**, **assault rifle**, **battle rifle**,
**light machinegun**, **sniper rifle**, and **heavy weapon**.

##### Pistol

Pistols are semi-automatic handguns such as the .357 magnum or a pulse
pistol.

***Range.*** Pistols are close-range weapons.

***Magazine Size.*** Pistols use small magazines. Pistols typically have
3-4 ammo-pips in their magazine with each pip representing 1 round.

***One-Handed.*** It only requires the one hand to use a pistol.

##### Submachine Gun (SMG)

SMGs are single-handed automatic weapons such as an MP5k or plasmagat.

***Range.*** SMGs are close-range weapons.

***Magazine Size.*** SMGs use medium magazine. SMGs typically have 3-4
ammo-pips in their magazine with each pip representing 5 rounds.

***One-Handed.*** It only requires the one hand to use an SMG.

##### Shotgun

Shotguns are scattershot firearms or anything that shoots shells such as
a double-barrel shotgun or a plasmaspaz.

***Range.*** Shotguns are close-range weapons.

***Magazine Size.*** Shotguns use small magazines. Shotguns typically
have 3-4 ammo-pips in their magazine with each pip representing 1 shell.

***Spread.*** Because of their spread, shotguns deal only half their
damage at long-range.

##### Assault Rifles (AR)

ARs are fully automatic, two-handed rifles that typically use small to
mid-size calibers. Some ARs include the AUG and the tesla gun.

***Range.*** ARs are mid-range weapons.

***Magazine Size.*** ARs use medium magazines. ARs typically have 4-5
ammo-pips in their magazine with each pip representing 5 rounds.

##### Battle Rifle (BR)

BRs are single-auto, two-handed rifles that typically use mid-size to
large calibers. Some BRs include the hunting rifle and the laser rifle.

***Range.*** BRs are mid-range weapons.

***Magazine Size.*** BRs use small magazines. BRs typically have 4-5
ammo-pips in their magazine with each pip representing 1 round.

##### Light Machinegun (LMG)

LMGs are large, fully-automatic weapons that use large calibers. Some
LMGs include the MG43 and the minigun.

***Range.*** LMGs are mid-range weapons.

***Magazine Size.*** LMGs use large magazines. LMGs typically have 5-6
ammo-pips in their magazine with each pip representing 10 rounds.

**Heavy-Duty.** LMGs require a Major action to reload and you lose 5
feet of speed while using them.

##### Sniper Rifle

Snipers are long-barreled precision rifles used against long-range
targets and typically use larger calibers. Some snipers include the
DKS-501 and the Gauss rifle.

***Range***. Snipers are long-range weapons.

***Magazine Size.*** Snipers use small magazines. Snipers typically have
3-4 ammo-pips in their magazine with each pip representing 1 round.

##### Heavy Weapon

Heavy weapons are massive, destructive weapons that fire heavy
munitions. Some heavy weapons include the fat man and the incinerator.

***Range.*** Heavy weapons are close-range weapons.

***Magazine Size.*** Heavy weapons use large magazines. Heavy weapons
typically have only 1 ammo-pip in their magazine with that pip
representing 1 munition, but there are exceptions.

**Heavy-Duty.** Heavy weapons require a Major action to reload and you
lose 5 feet of speed while using them.

#### Ranged Types

Along with the number of ranged weapon classes, there are several ranged
weapon types. Ranged types determine the kind of damage a ranged weapon
does and what kind of ammunition it can use in addition to various
properties.

##### Projectile

Projectile weapons fire bullets or other solid objects toward a target
to achieve damaging effects by direct application of kinetic energy.
There are two kinds of projectile weapons, **ballistic** and **gauss**
weapons.

###### Ballistic

Ballistic weapons are the most common firearms found in the wasteland.
Ballistic weapons deal ballistic damage and use the standard ammunition
types as well as their special variants.

###### Gauss

Gauss weapons are ballistic weapons that use magnetic coils to propel
projectiles at devastating speeds. Gauss weapons can be spooled-up to
deal +1d8 on their damage roll at the cost of a Minor action. Gauss
weapons can only use 2mm EC cartridges.

##### Energy

Energy weapons inflict damage at a target by emission of highly
focused energy. There are five kinds of energy weapons: **cryo**,
**flame**, **laser**, **plasma**, and **tesla** weapons.

**Intelligence Scaling.** All energy weapons have Intelligence scaling,
meaning that you add your Intelligence score to your attack damage when
using them.

###### Cryo

Cryo weapons spray cryogenic chemicals and compounds to freeze their
targets. Cryo weapons deal cryo damage and stagger their targets on hit.
Cryo weapons can only use cryo cell ammunition.

###### Flame

Flame weapons spray streams of extremely hot, flaming liquid to engulf
their enemies in fire. Flame weapons deal fire damage and set their
targets on fire. Flame weapons can only use flamer fuel.

###### Laser

Laser weapons fire focused beams of light energy to damage their
targets. Energy weapons gain +1 on attack rolls but roll with
disadvantage on damage rolls and deal less bonus damage. Laser weapons
deal laser damage and can use MF cells and their variants.

###### Plasma

Plasma weapons fire slow-moving, super-heated globs of plasma at their
targets. Plasma weapons suffer -1 on attack rolls but gain advantage on
damage rolls and typically deal more bonus damage. Plasma weapons deal
plasma damage and can use MF cells and their variants.

###### Tesla

Tesla weapons fire arcs of electricity at their targets which spread to
their surroundings. Tesla weapons have low attack damage but deal 1d12
damage to all targets within 15 feet which spreads to any un-hit targets
within 10 feet of each other. Tesla weapons deal tesla damage and can
use MF cells and their variants.

#### Special Ammunition

In addition to a ranged weapon's default ammunition as defined by its
class and type, there is an assortment of special munitions that can be
used to bolster your attacks with unique effects. The different kinds of
special ammo and their available weapon classes/types are listed in the
item lists chapter.

Chapter 12: Accessories
-----------------------

The only thing that separates us from the animals is our ability to
accessorize. You can upgrade and modify your weapons and armor with
accessories to give them additional bonuses and effects.

Weapon and armor accessories can be bought from relevant merchants or
found as loot in the dungeons of the wastes. You can pay a merchant 100
caps to install an accessory or try to install it yourself by passing a
DC 10 Repair check, however, if you fail the check the accessory may
become damaged and need to be repaired.

Some accessories do not need to be installed to be used, such as a
Stealth-Boy or an eyepatch. Accessories that could reasonably be slipped
on or off can be simply equipped or unequipped at the cost of a Minor
action.

### Armor Accessories

You might want to add a cape to your favorite set of armor or wear a
bandana to hide your face. Armor accessories allow you to add personal
flair to your helmets and armor and grant bonus effects to them. Armor
accessories fall under two categories: **armor set accessories** and
**face accessories**.

**Conflicting Slots**. Armor accessories can be worn on various parts of
the body, but you cannot have two armor accessories occupying the same
place. For example, if you have a Pip-Boy 3000 on your wrist, you could
not then wear a gauntlet or watch on that same wrist.

**Close-Faced Helmets.** Face accessories can only be worn in
conjunction with open-faced helmets. Helmets are open-faced by default,
but other helmets such as a welder's mask or a power helmet are
close-faced and thus cannot be worn alongside face accessories.

### Weapon Mods

Your weapons of choice can be outfitted with upgrades called weapon
mods. There are various weapon modifications for both melee and ranged
weapons, however, there are differing rules on how many and where weapon
mods can be attached depending on which kind of weapon you are using.

**Melee Weapons.** Melee weapons can only have two weapon mods at a
time: one on the grip and one on the weapon itself. Melee weapon mods
must also be installed before gaining their bonuses.

**Ranged Weapons.** Ranged weapons can have mods on various parts of the
weapon. For most ranged weapons there are three mod slots: the
upper-rail, the under-rail, and the magazine. Ranged weapon mods are
easier to attach, and thus can be equipped/unequipped with the use of a
Minor action.

Chapter 13: Combat Tools
------------------------

In addition to your primary weapons you have many additional tools of
destruction at your fingertips. You can use **thrown weapons**,
**grenades**, and **mines** to deal damage and disrupt your enemies. The
details of each type of combat tool is laid out in this chapter.

**Action Cost.** It only costs a Minor action to use a combat tool and
can be combined with the Access the Inventory action.

**Range.** Combat tools can be thrown as far as your throwing distance
(5 x Strength ft.) and are considered close-range weapons.

### Thrown Weapons

Throwing weapons can be used to attack or disrupt targets that are at a
distance and can pose as deadly ranged tools for melee characters.

**Attack Rolls.** Making an attack with a thrown weapon behaves
similarly to making an attack with a ranged weapon, except instead of
using your Perception modifier on the attack roll, you use your Strength
modifier.

**Damage Scaling.** Thrown weapons that hit a target directly have
Strength scaling (or Agility scaling if it's a finesse weapon).

### Grenades

Grenades are useful for displacing enemy units or dealing large amounts
of damage over a large area of effect.

**Uncooked Grenades.** Uncooked grenades can be thrown anywhere within
your throwing distance and explode 1 round after they are thrown.

**Cooking Grenades.** If you wish to have a grenade explode as soon as
it lands on its target, you will need to **cook** it first. To cook a
grenade, you make a DC 10 Explosives check. If you fail, the grenade
blows up prematurely in the air and deals no damage. Cooking a grenade
costs an additional Minor action.

**Throwing Back.** You can throw back uncooked grenades at the cost of a
Minor action but must pass a DC 20 Explosives check. If you fail, the
grenade explodes in your hands.

**Damage Radius.** Grenades deal their base damage in an area of effect
defined by their damage radius.

### Mines

Mines can be used to block off pathways and useful avenues of movement
for your enemies or spring a deadly trap.

**Motion Sensors.** Mines have motion sensors that activate 1 round
after they are placed or thrown. Any character that moves within the
sensor radius detonates the mine when they are active.

**Damage Radius.** Mines deal their base damage in an area of effect
defined by their damage radius, which is typically the same distance as
their sensor radius.

**Hiding Mines.** Mines can be hidden in deep brush or in the ground
using a tool such as a shovel. When hiding a mine, you make an
Explosives check that must be beaten by an opposing characters passive
Perception when crossing into the mine's sensor radius or by a
Perception check via the Search action to be detected. Hiding a mine
costs a Minor action and delays the activation of the motion sensors by
1 round.

 Chapter 14: Consumables
------------------------

Sometimes you might need a helping hand in the middle of a firefight.
Luckily there are an assortment of different consumables at your
disposal to replenish your health, alleviate status effects, and give
you useful buffs to help you vanquish your foes. The details of **aid**,
**chems**, and **food** items, useful for any survivor braving the
wasteland, are described in this chapter.

### Aid

Aid items such as bandages and stimpaks are useful when you are
afflicted with status effects or wounded.

**Medicine Skill.** Your medicine skill is added to any hit points
regained using aid items. If the aid item calls for multiple rolls of a
die or multiple dice, you only add your Medicine skill to one.

### Chems

There is a wide variety of drugs, otherwise known as chems, that you can
take to modify your ability scores and receive unique effects. chems are
extremely useful in the heat of battle but should only be used in
moderation due to their addictive properties.

**Chem duration.** The effects of chems last for multiple rounds. The
duration of a chems effects are listed in its description.

**Addiction Saves.** Whenever you take a chem, you must pass an
Endurance save called an addiction save to avoid becoming addicted to
that chem. The roll required to avoid addiction is different for each
chem and is listed in it description. Taking the same chem twice within
a 24-hour period will force you to roll with disadvantage on your
addiction save, and you always roll with disadvantage on addiction saves
against chems that you have been previously addicted to.

**Effects of Addiction.** When suffering from addiction, you roll with
disadvantage on all rolls when not under the influence of that chem.

**Curing Addiction.** Chem addiction can only be cured in two ways:
visiting a doctor or using fixer (another chem).

### Food

In addition to aid items, you can consume indigenous wasteland flora and
fauna or packaged foodstuffs from the Pre-War to regain lost hit points.
Most food found in the wasteland is contaminated with radiation, so
beware before you bite.

**Rads.** Different food items inflict different levels of radiation.
The amount of rads taken by ingesting a particular food item is listed
in its description.
